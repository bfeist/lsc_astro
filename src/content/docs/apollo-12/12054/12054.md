### **Introduction**

Lunar sample 12054 is an ilmenite basalt with 4.7 wt. percent TiO2 (Neal et al. 1994). It is one of only a few mare basalts with shock features (Schaal and Hörz 1977).

Much of 12054 has been coated by a large glass splash (figure 1). The glass is described as yellowish orange to reddish brown and is about 0.5 mm thick in most places. According to Schaal and Hörz, the glass coating did not form *in situ*, but was deposited as an "impact melt splash derived from a basalt similar to 12054" (not soil).

12054 has been used for numerous "consortium studies" related to exposure phenomena (micrometeorites, sputtering, solar-flare tracks, ion implantation etc). In fact, this rock was used as a sort of "standard" for micrometeorite "zap" pit, cosmicray track studies and irradiation history because it had a known orientation, glass coating and relatively simple history (Hartung et al. 1978, Zook 1978). The orientation of Apollo 12 samples is discussed in Sutton and Schaber (1971) and Hartung et al. (1978) who match a picture of 12054 from the lunar surface with artificial lighting in the laboratory.

# **Petrography**

The basaltic texture of 12054 can be seen in the photos of the sawn surfaces (figure 8, 9). Dungan and Brown (1977) briefly describe 12054 as medium-grained, equigranular, with lath-shaped plagioclase and equant to slightly elongate pyroxene intergrown, suggestive of coetectic crystallization. Elongate ilmenite and small segregations of "symplectoid mesostasis" are common features. Schaal and Hörz (1977a) and Neal et al. (1994) classify 12054 as an ilmenite basalt. Schaal and Hörz find that 12054 has been shocked to ~250 450 kbars. Diaplectic feldspars are highly fractured. Pyroxene crystals exhibit pronounced undulatory extinction and decreased birefringence.

The glass coating is a flowed basaltic melt which thermally modified 12054 along its contact. The glass contains oblong vesicles (up to 1.2 mm) and schlieren up to 0.4 mm. Schaal and Hörz describe "dendrites" in some of the glass.

Hörz et al. (1971), Hartung et al. (1972, 1978), Morrison and Zinner (1977), and Mandeville (1977) carefully studied the size frequency distribution of micrometeorites and solar flare track density on the glass surface of 12054 (figure 9). McDonnell (1977) and Zook (1978) reported on the accreta and dust on the surfaces of 12054 (figures 2, 12).

# **Mineralogy**

*Pyroxene:* Pyroxene shows "patchy extinction" and a "marked decrease in birefringence". Pyroxene compositions were determined by Schaal and Hörz (1977) (figure 3).

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase in 12054 is shocked to maskelynite (An93 – An89).

*Ilmenite:* Long ilmenite needles (~0.8 cm) can be seen in photos of the slabbed surfaces (figures 8, 10). Ilmenite is fractured and has "bent lamellae less than 15 micons wide".

*Glass:* The glass coating on 12054 (figure 9) was analyzed by Schaal and Hörz (1977).

### **Chemistry**

O'Kelley et al. (1971a) determined U, Th and K by radiation counting (table 1). Neal et al. (1994) reanalyzed 12054 and found the earlier analysis by Rhodes et al. (1977) to be repeatable (figure 5).

### **Radiogenic age dating**

The crystallization age of 12054 has not been determined. The age of the shock event is also unknown.

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

O'Kelley et al. (1971b) determined the activity 22Na = 39 ± 7 dpm/kg, 26Al = 50 ± 10 dpm/kg, 46Sc = 52 ± dpm/kg, 54Mn = 36 ± 5 dpm/kg, and 56Co = 40 ± 10 dpm/kg.

Bogard et al. (1971) determined rare gasses in 12054 and Hartung et al. (1977) measured He, Ne and Ar on sunlit and shaded surfaces of 12054 by laser ablation mass spectroscopy. Kerridge (1991) used this data to calculate the sputter-erosion rate of the lunar surface (<0.24 microns/m.y.).

Morrison and Zinner (1977) calculate an exposure age of 1.75 x 105 yr. using the track production rate of Blanford et al. (1975) and 1.6 x 105 yr. based on 26Al. This is comparable to the galactic cosmic ray exposure age of 1.5 x 105 yr. from the data of Bogard.

### **Other Studies**

Samples were apparently allocated to Arnold and Nishiizumi for cosmic ray depth profile studies (unpublished?).

### **Processing**

Figure 11 shows a schematic drawing of the slab that was cut through 12054 (figure 9, 10). Only two thin sections were prepared There are 4 thin sections.
