## **Introduction**

12034 was collected from the bottom of the same trench as soil sample 12033. These samples were located about 15 meters inside the rim of Head Crater (Schoemaker et al. 1970). *"Let's sample that rock that I dug up from down deep (~15 cm). Let me get a photo of it (AS12-49-7195 - 6)".* 

12034 is a regolith breccia, but it is largely made up of components foreign to the Apollo 12 regolith and is from some distant, non-mare, regolith (figure 1). It contains abundant KREEP; both as glasses and annealed lithic fragments.

12034 has not been dated, but there is evidence in the U/Pb data that there has been a young event.

## **Petrography**

Simon et al. (1985) described regolith breccias from Apollo 12 and give new analyses. They note that although 12034 is a soil breccia, it is unlike the soils at

Sample 12034 is a fragmental matrix breccia similar in appearance to the Apollo 11 fragmental matrix breccias, but with a much lower porosity (figure 2). According to McGee et al. (1979) it consists of a variety of glass, mineral and lithic clasts contained in a matrix of brown glass fragments and comminuted debris (figure 3). The texture of the matrix is seriate with fragments ranging in size from the limit of resolution up to 2 mm. Brown glass fragments dominate the less than 0.05 mm size fraction (Phinney et al. 1976). Waters et al. (1971) noted a vague stratified nature of the sample. Chao et al. (1971) and Anderson and Smith (1971) reported 14% and 10% pore space, respectively.

The glass clast population in 12034 is extremely diverse, ranging from colorless, pale green, yellow or orange homogeneous glass to completely devitrified glass with included mineral grains (Chao et al. 1971; von Engelhardt et al. 1971). Subrounded to rounded fragments of maskelynite and devitrified maskelynite occur commonly as inclusions in the large devitrified glass clasts. Devitrification features in glass clasts take the form of vaiolitic clusters of plagioclase needles and more commonly axiolitic intergrowths of tightly packed plagioclase and pyroxene crystals (McGee et al. 1979).

The lithic clasts in 12034 include basalts, dark-matrix breccia, cataclastic anorthosite and anorthositic gabbro (see modes in tables). Rare basalts have textures ranging from ophitic to vitrophryic. Anderson and Smith (1971) reported "grey mottled" basalts in 12034. These are made up of about half plagioclase and half low-Ca pyroxene (orthopyroxene?) and have the bulk

composition of KREEP. Based on what we know now, they are probably fragments of impact melt.

## **Chemistry**

One can use the whole rock U and Th measurements from radiation counting (O'Kelley et al. 1971, Rancitelli et al. 1971) to judge which analyses are representative of the sample (table 1). The split obtained by Simon et al. (1985) is high in U and Th, while the splits analyzed by Goles et al. (1971) and Wakita et al. (1971) appear low.

Using chemical mixing models, but with different assumed compositions for end members, Meyer et al. (1971) calculated that 12034 is ~30 % mare basalt, ~5 % anorthosite and ~ 66 % KREEP, while Simon et al. (1985) calculated that 12034 is ~ 1 % basalt, 8 % anorthosite and 89 % low-KREEP. Finally, McKay et al. (1971) calculated ~ 56 % KREEP for 12034, using K, Rb and Ba only.

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Tatsumoto et al. (1971) determined the U, Th and Pb isotopes in 12034, providing evidence for a young event (figure 7). The Nd – Sm data give a model age for KREEP in 12034 of 4.3 – 4.4 b.y. (Lugmair and Carlson 1978).

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

O'Kelly et al. (1971) determined the cosmic ray induced activity of 12034 as 22Na = 29 dpm/kg, 26Al = 45 dpm/kg, 46Sc = <10 dpm/kg, 48V = <60 dpm/kg, 54Mn = 16 dpm/kg, 56Co = <16 dpm/kg and 60Co = < 4 dpm/ kg. Rancitelli et al. (1971) determined 22Na = 34 dpm/ kg, 26Al = 60 dpm/kg, 54Mn = <40 dpm/kg, 56Co = <56 dpm/kg and 60Co = 1.5 dpm/kg. Breccia 12034 was shielded from solar cosmic rays, having been buried in a trench.

Basford et al. (1973) determined the isotopic composition of Kr and Xe, but do not give an expsoure age.

## **Processing**

One end was cut off 12034 in 1970, and in 1975, a small slab was cut (see figures). There are 16 thin sections. 12034 was never studied in "consortium mode".
