#### Introduction

12070 is the fines from the contingency sample taken by the astronauts. It was collected in front of the Lunar Module (figure 1). Rock samples 12071 – 12077 were also collected as part of the contingency sample and returned in this bag.

12070 is the best studied of the Apollo 12 soils, with many analyses.

#### **Petrography**

The maturity index of 12070 is  $I_s/FeO = 47$  and the average grain size of is 51 microns (figure 5).

At the time of Apollo 12, different research groups did not report consistent mineral modes for soils samples, because they didn't use the same criteria and they

# **Mineralogical Mode (250-1000 microns)**

studied different size fractions. Frondel et al. (1971) determined the mineral mode, but did not specify agglutinates. McKay's group recognized "glazed aggregates" which were later called agglutinates. Marvin et al. (1971) found about 30% "cindery glasses" (figure 4).

Delano et al. (1981) reported on the trends in composition of numerous glass particles from 12070

(figure 7). Chao et al. (1970), Engelhardt et al. (1971), Bunch et al. (1972), Barra et al. (2006) and others also give the composition of glass particles from 12070). Stone et al. (1982) studied a few individual glass beads using magnetic means.

Marvin et al. (1991) report on the nature of a granitic particle from 12070 first reported by Marvin et al. (1971). Dence et al. (1971) studied the mineralogy of basalt particles from 12070.

### **Chemistry**

Lunar soil sample 12070 is one of the most analyzed of all lunar samples, and rightly or wrongly, is the true test of accuracy and precision of various analytical techniques (and labs) during the early Apollo era. For example, the preliminary PET results, as reported by LSPET, were specifically meant to be "quick and dirty" for the first three mission, but were improved to be "state of the art" for Apollo 15, 16 and 17. Note that 12070 was reanalyzed during the Apollo 15 mission, by XRF instead of SSMS (table 1a). However, please also note that although 12070 was sieved (sifted), it was not split according to analytical standards and that analysts frequently got widely different results on different splits analyzed at the same time in the same lab by the same technique (i.e. the sample was inherently heterogeneous).

Figure 6 shows the REE content of 12070. Hubbard et al. (1971), Schoenfelt and Meyer (1972), Goles et al. (1971) and Wanke et al. (1972) all tried to calculate the amount of KREEP material in 12070 and other Apollo 12 soils.

The carbon content of 12070 was reported by Epstein and Taylor (1971) as 145 ppm. Muller (1972) determined 80 ppm N by the Kjeldahl technique. Kerridge et al. (1978) found 128 ppm C and 67 ppm N (figure 3). These analyses also indicate that this soil has a high maturity and was exposed to the solar flux a long time.

### **Age Dating**

Barra et al. (2006) reported Ar/Ar ages for glass particles.

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Rancitellli et al. (1971), Wrigley (1971) and O'Kelly et al. (1971b) reported the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 22Na = 80 dpm/kg, 75 dpm/kg and 70 dpm/kg

average grain size = 51 microns

respectively. The activity of 26Al = 165 dpm/kg, 171 dpm/kg and 146 dpm/kg, respectivly. The activity of 46Sc = 5.9 dpm/kg. The activity of 54Mn = 21 dpm/kg and 41 dpm/kg. The activity of 56Co = 57 dpm/kg, and 55 dpm/kg. Herr et al. (1972) reported 14.1 cpm for 54Mn and 380 dpm/kg for 53Mn.

D'Amico et al. (1971) studied radioactivity of tritium in 12070 and other soils.

Hintenberger and Weber (1973) calculate the 21Ne exposure age of 12070 as 300 m.y. and the 38Ar exposure age is 610 m.y.

# **Other Studies**

Some rare gas data is given in the Apollo 11 catalog (Warner 1970) and in LSPET (1970). Yanif and Heymann (1972), Pepin et al. 91972), Funkhauser et al. (1971), and Hintenberger et al. (1971) also reported rare gas measurements.

Arrhenius et al. (1971) studied the frequency of grains with high fossil nuclear tracks in 12070 (and all other Apollo 12 soil and core samples)(figure 8).

Gammage and Holmes (1975) determined the specific surface area of 12070 and other lunar fines.

### **Processing**

Portions of 12070 were sieved at different times, and it is difficult to determine which splits are < 1 mm, 1 – 2 mm, 2 – 4 mm and 4 – 10 mm. With regard the large number of chemical analyses this sample, it is important to recognize that the fines were not split in a scientific manner.
