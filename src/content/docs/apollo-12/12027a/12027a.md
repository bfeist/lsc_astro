#### Introduction

Drive tube 12027 was collected from the bottom of the trench (20 cm deep) where 12023 and 12024 were collected (figure 1). It was 17 cm long and extended the depth below surface from 20 to 37 cm, although length and depth do not correspond well for Apollo 12 drive tubes. Newsletter #26 gives the initial description.

#### **Petrography**

Morris and Lauer (1982) determined the maturity of samples from different depths of core 12027 (figure 4). The top and bottom of the core were found to be submature ( $I_s/FeO = 40$ ), while the middle section was mature ( $I_s/FeO = 75$ ).

Nagle J.S. (1980) studied the percentage of particles in each size range. There was a lot of coarse basalt particles in the zone from 1 to 2.5 cm and an abundance of agglutinates at the bottom of the core (figure 5).

Smith et al. (1984) determined the mode from thin section for the entire length of the core. Figure 6 is for split # 375. Smith et al found that he agglutinate content is low ~ 10 - 20 % for the entire core.

## **Chemistry**

Smith et al. (1984) analyzed the entire length of 12027. The chemical composition of the top portion (,375) should be compared with that of sample 12023 collected from the bottom of the same trench. The base of the core is KREEP-rich (figure 7).

## **Processing**

The Apollo 12 core tube were 2 cm in diameter (Allton 1989). Core dissection took place in one pass. A portion of the core remaining in the tray after dissection

was encapsulated in epoxy and two sets of thin sections were prepared. A polished surface of the encapsulated core is seen in figure at end of this section.
