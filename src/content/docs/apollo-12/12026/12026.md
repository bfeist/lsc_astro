#### **Introduction**

12026 is a single drive tube taken near the LM, at the end of the first EVA (figure 1). It was found to contain 19 cm of material, but this may not represent the depth into the regolith.

" … now it's full length, and let me take a picture of it and that will be it".

The 12026 core was dedicated to the quarantine protocol.

## **Petrography**

According to the Core Catalog (Duke and Nagle 1976), the core was uniformly medium-dark grey and layering *Figure 2: Map of Apollo 12 site.*

was not apparent. There were noticeably more large particles below the depth of 5.9 cm.

The average grain size is 62 to 74 microns for the top and middle and 110 microns for the bottom.

#### **Chemistry**

The bulk composition of this core has not been measured, but since the 12026 drive tube was near the LM, its chemical composition should be that of 12001 or 12070 which were also from the area near the LM.

#### **Other Studies**

Used for biological quarantine studies.

## **Processing**

The Apollo 12 cores were 2 cm in diameter (Allton 1989). The core liner was in two pieces, making it easy to split open.

Half of 12026 was removed along the length of the core in three sections (A, B, C) defined by apparent cracks in the soil. These split were each individually sieved to obtain grain-size distributions and then turned over to biologists for quarantine tests.

It is not clear what remains of this core, but if some material remains it ought to be analyzed.
