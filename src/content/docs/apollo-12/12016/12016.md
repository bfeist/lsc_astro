## **Introduction**

12016 is rounded on all sides with abundant micrometeorite pits. Remnants of glass linings from large zap pits are present. Neal et al. (1994) classify it as an ilmenite basalt. It has not been dated.

## **Petrography**

Dungan and Brown (1977) report that 12016 "is an equigranular, medium-grained microgabbro" somewhat similar to 12056. Olivine in 12016 is resorbed and often included within pyroxene grains. Pyroxenes tend to be elongate (0.5 to 1 mm) and occur as complex intergrowths of augite and pigeonite. Plagioclase occurs interstitially, and is sometimes "subpoikililitic". The mesostasis of 12016 includes grains of fayalite, silica and phosphate in a cryptocrystalline matrix of devitrified glass.

Neal et al. (1994) found identical mode to that determined by Dungan and Brown (1977).

*Olivine:* The core of a large olivine phenocryst is Fo67, but olivine apparently re-equilibrated.

*Pyroxene:* The composition of pyroxene in 12016 is given in figure 3. The cores of pyroxene are a complex mixture of augite and low-Ca pyroxene (not understood).

*Plagioclase:* Feldspar is normally zoned An90-80 with significant Or content at rim adjacent to mesostasis (Dungan and Brown).

*Opaques:* Ulvöspinel and ilmenite in 12016 were analyzed by Dungan and Brown.

*Metal:* Metal grains with up to 10 wt % Ni are reported (figure 4).

## **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of 12016 has been determined by Rancitelli et al. (1971), Rhodes et al. (1977) and Neal et al. (1994) (Table 1 and figures 2,5).

## **Radiogenic age dating**

12016 has not been dated.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Rancitelli et al. (1971) determined the cosmic ray induced activity of 22Na (44 dpm/kg), 26Al (75 dpm/ kg), 46Sc (5.6 dpm/kg), 54Mn (36 dpm/kg) and 56Co (14 dpm/kg).

## **Processing**

A large piece (,7) was cut off of 12016 in 1976 (no slab).
