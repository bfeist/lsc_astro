### **Introduction**

### **Petrography**

Chao et al. (1971) studied a thin section (figure 3) and **Chemistry**  reported a mode. none

10025w as collected as part of the contingency sample Kramer et al. (1979) noted that there were zap pits (with from the area immediately in front of the Lunar Module raised rims!). Chao et al. (1971) illustrate a cross (LM). It is a friable regolith breccia (figure 1).. section thru one of these micrometeorite crater in 10025 (figure 2).

## **Processing**

Apollo 11 samples were originally described and cataloged in 1969 and "recataloged" by Kramer et al. (1977). There are only two thin sections.
