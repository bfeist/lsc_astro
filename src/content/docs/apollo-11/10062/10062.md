### **Introduction**

10062 is an old, low-K, high-Ti basalt from Apollo 11. Based on texture and composition, James and Wright (1972) termed 10062 an ophitic ilmenite basalt, whereas Gamble et al. (1978) describe the texture as subophitic (figure 1). At 3.8 b.y., basalt 10062 is one of the oldest lunar mare basalts (other than those found as clasts in breccias). It has been exposed to cosmic rays for 90 m.y. (the apparent age of West Crater).

### **Petrography**

Schmitt et al. (1970) termed 10062 as a "coarsegrained, vuggy, ophitic, olivine basalt." Carter and MacGregor (1970), Beaty and Albee (1978), Gamble et al. (1978) and Kramer et al. (1977) provide petrographic descriptions of 10062. The texture is ophitic, with radiating lath-like and acicular crystals

of plagioclase, intergrown with tabular and skeletal crystals of ilmenite, irregular grains of zoned clinopyroxene and olivine (figure 2). Late stage silica, fayalite, ulvöspinel, troilite and apatite are present in the mesostasis.

The abundance of ilmenite is striking, with some grains as large as ~ 1 mm. Some ilmenite has relict cores of armalcolite, which appears to have been replaced and overgrown by ilmenite.

The origin of high-Ti basalts has been discussed by many authors (see for example Walker et al. 1975). Since 10062 is about the same age as 10003 and 10029 (Papanastassiou et al. 1977), and has similar mineralogy, chemistry and texture, Beaty and Albee

(1978) and Gamble et al. (1978) have concluded these three samples may be related to each other.

#### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Carter and MacGregor (1970) and Beaty and Albee (1978) report olivine compositions ranging Fo<sub>76-50</sub>. Rounded grains of olivine are often included in clinopyroxene suggesting a reaction relationship.

**Pyroxene:** Hollister and Hargraves (1970) describe the compositional zoning of pyroxene in 10062. Pigeonite appears to be exsolved on a fine scale. Pyroxene compositions were given by Beaty and Albee (1978) (figure 3).

**Plagioclase:** The composition of plagioclase is  $An_{94}$ . (Beaty and Albee 1978).

*Ilmenite:* Ilmenite crystals in 10062 are lath-shaped, often skeletal, and up to 1600 microns in long dimension (Gamble et al. 1978). Carter and MacGregor (1970) found lamellae of rutile and blebs of spinel exsolved from the larger grains of ilmenite.

**Armalcolite:** LSPET (1969) and Carter and MacGregor (1970) reported rounded grains of dull grey armalcolite in the cores of ilmenite grains.

### **Chemistry**

10062 is a high-Ti, low-K Apollo 11 basalt (figure 4). The chemical composition of 10062 is tabulated in table 1. The rare earth elements (REE) and large ion lithophile elements (LIL) are depleted with respect to the high-K, Apollo 11 basalts (see section on 10057). There is a hint that La and Ce are also slightly depleted with respect to the other REE (figure 5).

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Turner (1970) and Guggisberg et al. (1979) dated 10062 by the Ar-Ar plateau method as 3.82 b.y. and 3.84 b.y. (respectively). Papanastassiou et al. (1977) dated 10062 by Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isochron methods and determined an even older age (figures 6 and 7). Other low-K, high-Ti Apollo 11 basalts are slightly younger and may be from a different flow(s).

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Turner et al. (1970) reported an exposure age of 90 m.y. by 38Ar.

# **Other Studies**

O'Hara et al. (1974) experimentally determined the liquid composition of 10062 (at 1120 deg. C) cotectic with olivine, clinopyroxene, anorthite and ilmenite at low pressure and made the case for the hypothesis that mare basalts are slowly consolidated giant lava lakes and not the result of partial melting of the deep lunar interior! However, Walker et al. (1975) review the origin of titaniferous lunar basalts by partial melting

and conclude that the preferred source region is a "latestage ilmenite-rich cumulate produced from the residual liquid of the primordial differentiation of the outer portion of the Moon."

The concentrations of Sm, Nd, Lu and Hf and the isotopic ratios of 143Nd/144Nd and 176Hf/177Hf were determined by Unruh et al. (1984).
