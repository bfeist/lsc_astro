Drive Tube 53.4 grams

## **Introduction**

Lunar drive tube 10005 was driven into the regolith about 25 cm, but only collected about 10 cm of material (figure 1).

The drive tubes were pressed into the regolith about 12 cm and hammered another 12 cm (Costes and Mitchell 1970). They were only partially filled, because the bit was wider than the tube, which required that the dry uncompressible soil had to "flow" into the tube ( the design was changed for later missions). The weight of 10005 given in the catalogs is 65 g (King 1969; Duke and Naugle 1976; Lunar Sourcebook). Apparently 15.5 grams fell out of the cap when this core was first opened (*there is confusion about this*).

## **Petrography**

The Apollo 11 site was chosen to be flat and as free of rocks as possible. The regolith was found to be uniform over the whole area covered by the Astronauts and the soils all have similar composition.

Fryxell et al. (1970) initially dissected and described the core. A more thorough description was made by Allton (1978). 10005 "displayed a slightly lighter zone approximately 6 cm from the top surface. This zone is 2 to 5 mm thick with a sharp upper boundary and gradational lower boundary" (LSPET 1969a ). However, the grain size and material was not different from the dark material.

## **Chemistry**

Wakita et al. (1970) reported the chemical composition at five depths along the core (table 1). Note that the average is similar to that of 10084.

Ma et al. (1980) reported the composition of 11 small basalt fragments from 10005 (all high Ti).

Grain size distribution (dry sieving) is given in figure 4.

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Finkel et al. (1971) found a decrease with depth for 53Mn activity.

## **Other Studies**

Taylor et al. (1971), Oyama et al. (1971) and others conducted numerous investigations looking for organic compounds and/or evidence of any life in the lunar regolith using material from these cores.

Dalymple and Doell (1970) and Hoyt et al. (1970) studied thermoluminescence.

Fleischer et al. (1970), Crozaz et al. (1970) and Lal et al. (1970) studied nuclear tracks in minerals from these cores.

## **Processing**

When the core was initially opened in 1969, about half was allocated to the 'Biopool'. The material that fell out of the cap when the core was opened was also

allocated for organic analysis (Oyama et al. 1970). Initial allocations were from 0 cm, 2.6 cm, 5.2 cm, 7.8 cm and 10.5 cm (Allton 1978). Two samples (500 mg each) of 10005 were traded to the Soviet Union - from depths 3 cm and 9 cm - for samples of Luna cores.

The remaining half of drive tube 10005 was described and dissected (Allton 1978). It had apparently been stored upside down (see 10004). Although allocations were made to Morris and McKay, data is not available.

General information on drive tubes is found in another section of this compendium.
