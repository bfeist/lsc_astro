#### **Introduction**

10017 is the largest rock sample returned by Apollo 11. It is a fine-grained, vesicular, ilmenite basalt of the high-K variety (figure 1). The original crystallization age was determined as 3.6 b.y.

10017 was used for the study of solar- and cosmic-ray interaction with the lunar surface (Shedlovsky et al. 1970, SHRELLDALFF 1970). Shedlovsky et al. determined the orientation by radiation counting and found that *"most photographs made in the preliminary examination were in what we now consider a position inverted relative to its orientation on the moon."*  Overall, 10017 was found to have a high level of

cosmic-ray-induced radioactivity with an exposure age of 480 m.y.

Photos of 10017 taken before it was broken show that all sides are rounded and covered with micrometeorite craters and patina indicating that this sample "tumbled" while on the lunar surface (figures 2 and 3). However, one side is flatter and turned out to have been the surface that was most recently exposed on the Moon (from 56Co activity). Depth profiles of cosmic-rayinduced nuclear tracks were found on both the top and bottom sides of the sample. The sample has not always been in the orientation that it was found, and it is not

the most suitable sample for the separation of the nuclear effects caused by solar-ray and cosmic-ray radiation.

#### **Petrography**

There is a variability to the texture of 10017, even within a given thin section, which is due to apparent mineral segregations and differences in grain size (French et al. 1970; Dence et al. 1970). For this reason, and because petrologists were not familiar with high Ti basalts, a wide variety of descriptions and names were applied to Apollo 11 basalts. All investigators were surprised by the lack of any alteration. Mesostasis is glassy.

*Schmitt et al. (1970) originally described 10017 as a "poikiloblastic olivine basalt (very fine-grained, vesicular, vuggy, glass-bearing)." James and Jackson (1970) listed 10017 as "hornfelsic, intersertal basalt" where ilmenite and pyroxene "occur in mosaics of equant interlocking grains*  *and plagioclase forms coarse poikiloblastic crystals" (figure 4). Dence et al. (1970) describe the texture of 10017 as "intergranular", Brown et al. (1970) describe the texture as "hypidiomorphic granular" and McGee et al. (1977) described the texture as "intersertal."* 

Adler et al. (1970), French et al. (1970), Brown et al. (1970), Kushiro and Nakamura (1970), Dence et al. (1970), McGee et al. (1977), Beaty and Albee (1978) and others have provided detailed petrographic descriptions of 10017. 10017 is a fine- to mediumgrained basalt composed primarily of clinopyroxene, plagioclase and ilmenite, with minor mesostasis including high-K glass. Plagioclase megacrysts ate typically poikilitic and enclose anhedral pyroxene and ilmenite crystals. The rock is vesicular, with both circular and irregular vesicles about 0.2 to 0. 5 mm in size, which make up only a few percent of the sample. In 10017, pyroxenes are often granular, whereas plagioclase is anhedral to subhedral (Kushiro and

*Figure 3: Original photo taken in F-201 of "flatter" side of 10017,0 showing numerous, well-developed micrometeorite craters.

Nakamura 1970). The grain size is variable with shaped crystals, while adjacent areas are enriched in pyroxene and ilmenite from 50 to 150 microns, but smaller grains of pyroxene and ilmenite (see figure 1 plagioclase is up to 2 - 3 mm in length (French et al. in French et al. 1970). 1970). This high Ti, lunar basalt is unusual in that the ilmenite is equant rather than tabular. **Mineralogy**

## **Chemistry**

Compston et al. (1970), Gast et al. (1970) and others observed that Apollo 11 basalts could be divided in two groups based on the higher K and Rb contents of Group 1 as compared with that of Group 2 (low-K). 10017 belongs to the high-K group and also has higher REE content (figure 6). Anders et al. (1971) found that the meteoritic siderophiles (Ir and Au) were low in this igneous rock. Neal (2001) showed the Ni was low (table 1c). Gibson and Johnson (1970) determined the gas released from 10017 (figure 11).

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

Papanastassiou et al. (1970), deLaeter et al. (1973) and Gopalan et al. (1970) determined the Rb/Sr isochron age for 10017 (figures 8, 9). Turner (1970) determined the Ar/Ar age. Eberhardt et al. (1974) determined 2.35 b.y. by whole rock K/Ar.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Perkins et al. (1970) determined the cosmic ray induced activity of 22Na (45 dpm/kg), 26Al (80 dpm/kg), 46Sc (13 dpm/kg) and 54Mn (46 dpm/kg). O'Kelley et al. (1970) determined of 22Na (39 dpm/kg), 26Al (73 dpm/ kg), 46Sc (13 dpm/kg) and 54Mn (33 dpm/kg) and 56Co (26 dpm/kg). Wrigley and Quaide (1970) also determined 22Na (47 dpm/kg) and 26Al (83 dpm/kg) in

general agreement if one considers the counting errors (see references).

Eberhardt et al. (1970) observed that high-K basalts had distinctly different exposure ages from low-K Apollo 11 basalts. Eberhardt et al. (1974) determined the cosmic ray exposure age as 480 ± 25 m.y. by the reliable 83Kr method and 371 m.y. by 126Xe (as calculated by Srinivasan 1974) while Marti et al. (1970) determined 509 ± 29 m.y. by 83Kr and 308 m.y. by 126Xe (calculated). Turner (1970) and Hintenberger et al. (1971) reported exposure ages of 440 and 510 m.y. respectively by 38Ar.

Shedlovsky et al. (1970) and O'Kelley et al. (1970) reported significant 56Co (77 days) on the "top" surface of 10017 (125 and 44 dpm/kg respectively), thus establishing its most recent lunar surface orientation.

#### **Other Studies**

A detailed cosmic ray depth profile was attempted by Shredlldaff (1970), but only 22Na showed significant variation with depth (table 3). The problem is that this sample was irradiated on both sides, and it was not thick enough to stop high-energy cosmic rays. Additionally, the analytical techniques in 1969 required large subsamples. 10017 was the first of these studies, later carried out with more success on 14310, 68815 and 74275.

Fleischer et al. (1970), Lal et al. (1970) and Crozaz et al. (1970) studied solar flare and cosmic ray tracks as a function of depth in 10017 (figures 15 and 16). The near surface regions were dominated by solar flare

tracks and the erosion rate from micrometeorite bombardment could be determined.

Oxygen isotopes were reported for mineral separates of 10017 by Onuma et al. (1970) and Taylor and Epstein (1970).

O'Hara et al. (1970) and Ringwood and Essene (1970) experimentally determined the phase diagram for 10017 (figures 12 and 13). These experiments showed that Apollo 11 basalts probably formed at depths of 200 to 400 km by a small degree of partial melting from pyroxenitic source material.

Eugster et al. (1970) reported a significant isotopic anomaly in 158Gd proving that 10017 had received a high dosage of low energy neutrons over a long period of time (burial?).

Bogard et al. (1971) and Eberhardt et al. (1974) reported the abundance and isotopic ratios of noble gases in 10017.

The elastic properties for a lunar basalt (compressibility, sound velocity) were determined on 10017 by Anderson et al. (1970). The magnetic properties of 10017 were determined by Runcorn et al. (1970) and the remanent magnetization was found to be weak.

### **Processing**

10017 was returned in ALSRC #1004 and originally processed in the "Vac Lab". It was one of the rocks in the F-201 at the time of the glove rupture (with

exposure to Houston air). Apollo 11 samples were originally described and cataloged in 1969 and "recataloged" by Kramer et al. (1977).

10017 originally broke in two large pieces (,5 and ,6) along a penetrating fracture (figure 19). Surface pieces ,74 and ,42 from opposite ends of this fractured surface were allocated to Arnold.

Shredlldaff (1970) illustrated the cutting plan as it pertained to their depth profile studies (figure 14). A cube (,180) and a column (,64) were cut from the sample by sawing (figure 18). *All the King's men couldn't put 10017 together again !* 

*There are 24 thin sections for 10017.*
