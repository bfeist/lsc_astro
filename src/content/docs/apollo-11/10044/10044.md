#### **Introduction**

Lunar sample 10044 was collected in the area between the LM and the double elongate crater to the southwest of the LM and was returned in ALSRC #1003. It is a low-K variety of ilmenite basalt typical of Apollo 11, although analyses show it has lower Ti that the others. Figure 1 is an enlargement showing the igneous texture of a piece of 10044.

The crystallization age of 10044 has been determined as 3.7 b.y. and the cosmic ray exposure age is ~80 m.y. (age of West Crater?).

#### **Petrography**

Schmitt et al. (1970) termed 10044 as a "coarsegrained, vuggy, ophitic, cristobalite basalt" and James and Jackson (1970) termed it a "medium grained ophitic basalt" (figure 2). Bailey et al. (1970) reported that the pyroxene was equant and up to 2 mm, and plagioclase was 1.5 mm in size. Smith et al. (1970) and others have termed 10044 a "microgabbro". Albee and Chodos (1970) and Agrell et al. (1970) also reported petrographic details.

McGee et al. (1977) describe 10044 as "a coarsegrained porphyritic basalt which consists of subhedral to anhedral phenocrysts of pyroxene (1.0 -2.0 mm) set in a subophitic matrix of plagioclase tablets (0.2 x1.0 to 0.4x2.0 mm), anhedral pyroxene grains (0.6-0.8 mm), and ilmenite." Pyroxene is chemically zoned to Fe-rich pyroxferroite at the rims. Ilmenite is present

as laths (0.3-0.8 mm) and as irregular-shaped bodies. Dymek et al. (1975) also noted the remarkable Interstitial areas are filled with anhedral cristobalite, similarity of 10044 to 75055. troilite with metallic iron "blebs", K-rich glass and irregular-shaped vugs up to 0.3 mm (figure 3). **Mineralogy** 

10058 "are so similar to one another that it seems quite ilmenite and pyroxferroite. likely that these rocks are fragments of a larger block."

*Olivine:* There is essentially no olivine in 10044, but Beaty and Albee (1978) note that 10044, 10047 and Fuchs (1970) reported a thin grain of fayalite between

*Pyroxene:* Albee and Chodos (1970), Hafner and Virgo (1970) and Beaty and Albee (1978) reported the composition of pyroxene (figure 4). Albee and Chodos (1970) discovered that the pyroxene in 10044 was chemically zoned in sectors (figure 5). They found that the (010) sector contains about twice as much Ti, Al and Cr as the adjacent (001) sector; the substitution of 4+Ti for divalent 6-fold coordinated cations is balanced by twice as much 3+Al replacing 4-flold coordinated 4+Si. Bailey et al. (1970) reported the cell dimensions for exsolved pyroxene. The exsolution of pyroxene in 10044 was studied by Fernandez-Moran et al. (1970). Hafner and Virgo (1970) and Gay et al. (1970) determined the Mossbaurer spectra (figure 6) and determined the site distribution of cations in pyroxene.

*Pyroxferroite:* Chao et al. (1970) give the optical, chemical and crystallographic data for pyroxferroite.

*Plagioclase:* Goles et al. (1970) and Philpotts and Schnetzler (1970) determined the trace element content of plagioclase separates for 10044 (*however, see note about sample mix-up*).

*Ilmenite:* Cameron (1970) and Smith et al. (1970) found ilmenite was uniform in composition. Philpotts and Schnetzler (1970) determined the trace element content of ilmenite separate (figure 9), but clearly the ilmenite separate was contaminated by attached mesostasis with high trace element content.

*Ulvospinel:* Cameron (1970) reported ulvospinel with associated ilmenite and native iron.

*Silica:* This rock has abundant cristobalite (Beaty and Albee 1978) as well as tridymite (Smith et al. 1970).

*Apatite:* Albee and Chodos (1970) reported an analysis apatite in 10044. Fuchs (1970) gives analyses with 3.3 wt. % fluorine included.

*Y-Zr silicate:* Cameron (1970) reported a new mineral with abundant yttrium and zirconium in 10044.

### **Chemistry**

Engel and Engel (1970) and others reported the chemical composition (table 1). Rhodes and Blanchard (1980) and Neal (2001) reanalyzed the sample. Sample 10044 may have lower Ti than the other Apollo 11 basalts (figure 7), but it has similar REE (figure 8). Reed and Jovanovic (1970) determined F, Cl, Br, I, Li and Hg in 10044. Moore et al. (1970) reported 102 ppm C and 98 ppm N *(and termed it breccia*).

Both Goles et al. (1970) and Philpotts and Schnetzler (1970) analyzed carefully prepared mineral separates (figure 9).

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

Albee et al. (1970) and Papanastassiou et al. (1970) determined the Rb/Sr isochron age as ~ 3.7 b.y. for 10044 (figure 10). Davis et al. (1971) determined 4.00 ± 0.07 b.y. Turner (1970) and Guggisberg et al. (1979) determined the precise ages as 3.73 ± 0.05 b.y. and 3.71 ± 0.04 b.y. (figure 11) by the Ar/Ar plateau technique Murthy et al. (1970) determined the Sr isotopes.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Hohenberg et al. (1970) determined a 81Kr exposure age of 70 ± 17 m.y. and 72 m.y. by 126Xe (as calculated by Srinivasan 1974). Hintenberger et al. (1971) determined an 38Ar exposure age of 93 m.y. Turner et

al. (1970) and Guggisberg et al. (1979) determined 38Ar exposure ages of 70 m.y. and 82 m.y. respectively.

#### **Other Studies**

Oxygen isotopes were reported for mineral separates of 10044 by Onuma et al. (1970) and Taylor and Epstein (1970) (figure 13).

*Figure 13: Variation in oxygen isotopes in mineral separates of lunar basalts including 10044 (from Taylor and Epstein 1970).* 

Funkhauser et al. (1970), Hohenberg et al. (1970), Hintenberger et al. (1971) and Bogard et al. (1971) reported the abundance and isotopic composition of rare gasses from 10044.

Fleischer et al. (1970) carefully determined the U content and track density in minerals in 10044 (figure 14) and estimated a "proton exposure age" of ~250 m.y.

#### **Processing**

Figure 12 shows the external surfaces of 10044. Apollo 11 samples were originally described and cataloged in 1969 and "re-cataloged" by Kramer et al. (1977). There are 18 thin sections.
