# **Introduction**

10026, 10027 and 10028 were collected as part of the contingency sample from the area immediately in front of the Lunar Module (LM). They are similar to 10023 – 10025 from the same collection area, as well as the other Apollo 11 regolith breccias.

# **Petrography**

Engelhardt et al. (1971) give a modal analysis of 10027. There is an abundance of basalt clasts.

Kramer et al. (1977) noted that 10028 may have a different clast assemblage. Fruland (1983) and Simon et al. (1984) discuss Apollo 11 regolith breccias in general. Phinney et al. (1974) showed how to characterize these rocks by SEM petrography (but did not include these samples).

# **Chemistry**

none

# **Other Studies**

Funkhouser et al. (1970) determined rare gases in 10027 (figure 6).

# **Processing**

Apollo 11 samples were originally described and cataloged in 1969 and "recataloged" by Kramer et al. (1977). 10026, 10027 and 10028 were returned in the Contingency Sample Bag. There are 2 thin sections of 10026, 5 for 10027 and only 1 for 10028.
