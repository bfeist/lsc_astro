### Introduction

Sample 64500 was collected from a blocky area high up on the slope of Stone Mountain, and as such should primarily contain material from the Descartes Formation. It is a large sample from a loose regolith on the rim of a 15 meter crater. It included 11 walnut-sized samples (64505 - 64525) and an additional rake sample (64530) collected from the same location yielded 30 additional rocks (64535 - 64589). A double drive tube 64002/1 and a trench sample 64420 were collected nearby.

Note that some of the rocks from Stone Mountain were dilithologic breccias (e.g. 64535, 64475) and that 64501 has a very similar composition.

One might speculate that the 15 meter crater (Cinco a) was about 300 m.y. old, while the small double crater where the samples and the rocky area was caused by secondary material from South Ray Crater 2 m.y. ago (figure 2).

## **Petrography**

64500 was considered one of the reference soils by the Highland Initiative (Lobatka et al. 1980, Simon et al. 1981, Papike et al. 1982). Morris (1978) reported that 64500 was a mature soil with index  $I_s/FeO = 61$ . Heiken et al. (1973) found 51% agglutinates in the 90-150 micron size range, while Houck (1982) determined an average of  $\sim 29$  % agglutinate overall. Butler et al. (1973), Heiken et al. (1973) and Graf (1993) reported the grain size analysis (figure 5). The average grain size is about 110 microns.

Glass (1976) studied the glass particles in 64501 and found 5% were mare component, and a few were granitic in composition. However, he did not report a group called 'highland basalt', as did Ridley et al. (1973) for 60501. Delano (1975), Delano et al. (1981, 2007) and Kempa and Papike (1980) analyzed a large number of glass particles from 64501. Walker and Papike (1981) and Basu and McKay (1985) studied the formation of agglutinates, while See et al. (1986) studied the glass splashes on rocks (and presumably soil fragments).

Phinney and Lofgren (1973) described rake samples, while Marvin (1972) described the 4 - 10 mm coarse fine particles.

Devine et al. (1982) and Korotev (1981) discuss two different models for the derivation of the fine fraction (differential fracturing and mixing, respectively).

### **Mineralogy**

Mineral compositions were determined by Kempa and Papike (1980) and Labotka et al. (1980) with about half the pyroxene showing mare composition (figure 6). Bell and Mao (1973) studied the iron in plagioclase.

### **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of 64501 (table 1) is similar to that of the nearby trench soil (64420) and the double drive tube 64002. Finkelman et al. (1975) and Laul and Papike (1980) analyzed bulk soil and several grain size separates. Cirlin and Housley (1981) determined Cd and Zn and Jovanovic and Reed (1973) reported

Chemical analyses for rake samples from this location are tabulated in table 4. Korotev (1981) discussed the close chemical comparison of 64501 with that of dilithologic anorthositic breccias 64474 and 64548.

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Jessberger et al. (1977) have produced Ar/Ar ages for rake samples from 64535 and 64536.

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Clark and Keith (1973) determined the cosmic-rayinduced activity of 26Al = 160 dpm/kg., 22Na = 44 dpm/ kg., 54Mn = 6 dpm/kg. and 46Sc = 2.2 dpm/kg. Kirsten et al. (1973) reported a Ne exposure age of 210 m.y.

Jessberger et al. (1977) determined the exposure age of some of the rake samples from this soil. In particular, 64535 was found to be 1.9 m.y. old, consistent with excavation by South Ray Crater (see section on 64535).

### **Other Studies**

Kirsten et al. (1973) reported the rare gas content and isotopic ratios.

Rees and Thode (1975) determined the concentration and isotopic ratio of sulfur.
