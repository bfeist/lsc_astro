## 60050

Soil 225.8 grams

LMP: I'm going over to this crater and get you some of this white soil. I think it is coming off of this rock here, but it looks like caliche. I never thought I'd use that word up here, but that's what the coating looks like.

CDR: Gosh, Charlie, it does look like caliche.

LMP: Doesn't it look like caliche?

CDR: Yeah, but it's just a bunch of white frag, I believe.

#### Introduction

60050 was collected from the side of a small crater about 20 meters from the Apollo 16 deep drill core near the ALSEP station (figure 1). It was collected because it was lighter colored than the adjacent soil. It was found to include five friable rock fragments 60055 - 59, made of cataclastic anorthosite (table 2). The higher Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and lower REE content of the soil is apparently due to addition of this anorthosite (figure 5).

#### **Petrography**

60050 is a submature soil with a maturity index of Is/FeO = 57 (Morris 1978). Butler et al. (1973) and Graf

(1993) report the grain size analysis based on sieving (figure 7). Simkin et al. (1973) reported that the 1-2 mm coarse-fines (60052) contained 13 % anorthosite, 20 % plagioclase and only 9 % agglutinate particles. About 3 grams worth of anorthosite were found in the 4-10 mm fraction (figure 8).

### **Chemistry**

This soil is one of the most aluminous of the Apollo soils (figure 2), because of the addition of the friable anorthosite rocks that were collected along with it. The rare-earth-element content is between that of 60501, a soil colleted nearby, and anorthosites (60055 etc) found in the same bag (figure 5). Moore et al. (1973) reported 110 ppm carbon (figure 6).

### Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

Wrigley (1973) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of  ${}^{26}Al = 115$  dpm/kg and  ${}^{22}Na = 56$  dpm/kg.

#### **Other Studies**

Bogard D.D. and Nyquist L.E. (1973) and Signer et al. (1977) determined the rare gas content and isotopic ratios in bulk soil and various components. It was noted that most of the rare gas was located in the agglutinates. Exposure ages were not calculated.
