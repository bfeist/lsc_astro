#### Introduction

60014 – 60013 is one of the three cores that were collected close to one another (about 50 m apart) at the ALSEP site at Apollo 16 (figure 1). It wasn't extruded and dissected until 1991 and has not been well studied. However, enough has been learned to establish has three basic units: A (0 to 44 cm), B (44 to 59 cm) and C (59 to 62 cm) (Korotev and Morris 1993).

## **Petrography**

Basu et al. (1992, 1993) performed a grain size analysis and determined the percentage of glass, mineral and rock types in about 5 cm intervals (table 2). Basu et al. were not able to find any fragments or glasses of mare basalt composition, nor did they confirm the description based on X-rays.

Korotev and Morris (1993) determined the maturity along the core by magnetic resonance (figure 2). The top 44 cm is mature, but below a depth of about 44 cm the core samples are submature. Basu et al. (1993) also found fewer agglutinates at this depth.

Jolliff et al. (1993) reported on the composition and mineralogy of a small (0.1 mg) iron meteorite that they found in 60014. It was surrounded by agglutinate glass, but included tiny grains of low-Ca pyroxene (En<sub>83</sub>), olivine (Fo<sub>80</sub>), albitic and potassic feldspar, oldhamite(?) and hercynite(?). they even discuss whether this is a residual piece of the impactor responsible for the formation of the impact rocks at Apollo 16!

The continuous set of polished thin sections remains unstudied. A view of the epoxy encapsulated core segment is included herein (note the chunk at 44.5 cm).

### **Chemistry**

Korotev and Morris (1993) dutifully analyzed 124 splits (every 0.5 cm) of the double drive tube and ended up publishing averages for the three units (A, B, C)(table1). But, generally, one would have to conclude that the core is relatively homogeneous (figure 2).

## **Processing**

Horz et al. (1972) gave the first description – based on X-rays of the core. They originally subdivide the core into nine units. *Unit 9 (from 0 – 18.5 cm) is a massive fine-grained unit with sparse equant rock fragments,*  *with a concentration of rock fragments at 12 cm. Unit 8 (from 18.5 to38.5 cm) is also massive fine-grained - - -. Unit 7 (36.5 -38.5 cm) has a concentration of cmsized rock fragments - - . Unit 6 (38.5 to 44.5 cm) is fine-grained - - . Unit 5 (44.5 to 50.5 cm) has large*
