#### **Introduction**

60235 is a coherent impact melt rock with a mostly basaltic texture collected near the Lunar Module. There are micrometeorite craters on all sides and some vesicles are obvious. Otherwise, it has not been studied.

#### **Petrography**

According to Ryder and Norman (1980), "60235 is a plagioclase-rich basaltic melt. It consists of plagioclase laths 200-300 micron long (figure 2) which are frequently hollow and have square crosssections. Interstitial mineral are mainly pyroxene, with some mesostasis glass with opaque mineral and crystobalite. Clastic material consists of plagioclase and plagioclase-rich breccias."

Hunter and Taylor (1981) reported that there was abundant 'rust' on metal grains in thin sections of 60235.

### **Processing**

There are two thin sections ,5 and ,9 from the same potted butt.
