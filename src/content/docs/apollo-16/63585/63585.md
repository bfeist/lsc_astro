## **Introduction**

63585 is an impact melt breccia with regions that have basaltic texture and other areas that are poikilitic. It was collected as a rake sample from station 13, on the flank of North Ray Crater, Apollo 16, and has numerous micrometeorite craters on the surface (figure 1).

## **Petrography**

Warner et al. (1973) reported 63585 as a "basalt", while von Engelhardt (1979) found it was a poikilitic impact breccia. So it has regions with both textures (figures 2 and 3). The analyses of mafic mineral in the basaltic region are reproduced in figure 4. Hunter and Taylor (1980) reported lots of rust in 63585.

Compositional variation of Apollo 16 impact-melt rocks is discussed by Korotev (1994).

## **Chemistry**

Stoffler et al. (1985) reported an analysis. It is rather aluminous. The chip sent to Rhodes for analysis was apparently not analysed.

## **Other Studies**

Pearce and Simonds (1974) studied the magnetic properties.

## **Processing**

There are 5 thin section of 63585 and several chips.
