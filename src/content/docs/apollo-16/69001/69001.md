## **Introduction**

69001 is unopened and has been in vacuum since it was sealed in CSVC on the moon. It was collected about 10 meters from small boulder 69935, 69955 – see transcript.

According the soil mechanics report (Mitchell et al. 1972), 69001 was pushed in 20 cm and driven about another 7 cm by eight hammer blows.

## **Petrography**

Surface soil for comparison is the soil collected beneath the small station 9 boulder (69960).

## **Chemistry**

No data
