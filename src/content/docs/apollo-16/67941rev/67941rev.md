#### **Introduction**

Soil sample 67940 was collected from the regolith in a narrow E-W split in House Rock, station 11 (Sutton 1981). This sample was specifically collected to check on the idea that ionized rare gases may be accelerated along and redistributed by solar wind electric field along trajectories that are north-south (Horz et al. 1972). 67960 is the reference soil collected about 5 meters to the east of House Rock. House Rock is 3-10 m high and the opposing "Outhouse Rock" 2.5 m high; the crack between them is about 2 m long with the sample location about midway. *However, this soil is probably NOT permanently shadowed from the Sun (figure 1).* 

#### **Petrography**

67940 and 67960 are both immature soils from the near the rim of fresh North Ray Crater. Heiken et al. (1973) reported the mineralogical mode of 67940 – with only 12 % agglutinates. Morris (1978) found 67940 had a low maturity index (Is /FeO = 29). The average grain size of 67941 is 193 microns (high for an Apollo 16 soil). The reference soil (67960) was also immature with Is /FeO = 20.

Powell et al. (1975) studied the mineralogy of the rock fragments in soil 67941. Ryder and Norman (1980) cataloged the fragments (67945-67948) picked from this soil. House Rock and other samples of North Ray Crater are breccias.

#### **Chemistry**

Rose et al. (1975), Finkelman et al. (1975), Boynton et al. (1975), Eldridge et al. (1973) and Korotev (1982) determined the composition of 67940 and found it identical to the reference soil 67960 (table 1 and figures 5 and 7) and is typical of the regolith at North Ray Crater. Jovanovic and Reed (1973) studied the halogens in 67941 finding that they were within the range of other Apollo 16 materials.

Moore et al. (1975) reported 59 ppm carbon, consistent with low maturity (figure 6). Kerridge et al. (1975) and Moore and Lewis (1975) reported 27 ppm and 91 ppm nitrogen for 67941, respectively.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Eberhardt et al. (1976) give the average exposure age of 104 m.y. for 67941 and 95 m.y. for 67960 based on various rare gas isotope determinations. This is to be compared with the 50 m.y. old exposure age of the various boulders thrown out of North Ray Crater (dating the crater). Obviously, these soils contain an ancient regolith component that predates North Ray Crater. Eldridge et al. (1973) found 26Al = 158 dpm/kg and 22Na = 27 dpm/kg for 67941 and Yokoyama et al. (1975) found that 67941 "shows an almost saturated activity in solar cosmic (SCR) produced 26Al, in spite of complete shielding from SCR, which can be interpreted as the result of an intense lateral transport."

#### **Other Studies**

Eberhardt et al. (1976) carefully studied 67940 and multiple grain size separates of this sample for all the isotopes of the rare gases (figures 10 and 11). They found high excess 4 He and 40Ar which is typical of soils from the rims of relatively recent craters. However, they did not find less excess 40Ar in the shielded soil (67940) than the reference soil (67960), which had been predicted.

Wieler et al. (1980) included 67940 in their careful study of solar flare tracks compared with implanted solar wind rare gases. In general, they find a relatively constant ratio of tracks to implanted ions (ie.36Ar) but 67940 was significantly off the line (figure 9).

#### **Processing**

67460 has never been sieved.
