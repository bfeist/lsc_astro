### **Introduction**

64538 is a rake sample from station 4, Apollo 16 – see section on 64501. It is slightly different from 64546 etc., because it has three lithologies (figure 1) and the only analysis seems to be much more aluminous. The are micrometeorite craters on all surfaces.

### **Petrography**

Ryder and Norman (1980) provide the only description. There are three lithologies separated by sharp boundaries. Two lithologies seem to be those of the dimict breccia so common at this site. But the majority of the sample is a coherent, medium grey, glassy matrix lithology. Mineral chemistry is not reported.

### **Chemistry**

McKinley et al. (1983) reported the only analysis, which may be unrepresentative. The Ti content is very low and Al is very high.

### **Processing**

There are two thin sections of 64538.
