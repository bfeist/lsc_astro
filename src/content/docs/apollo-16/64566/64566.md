*Figure 1: Shows that 64566 is a complex mix of glass and light colored breccia.* 

## **Introduction**

64566 was collected as a rake sample from 64500.

### **Petrography**

It is a complex mix of glass and impact melt. Mineralogy has not been reported.

### **Chemistry**

McKinley et al. (1983) and Korotev (1994) appear to have analyzed the sample.

### **Radiogenic age dating**

none

### **Processing**

There is only one thin section and I don't have access to it.

# **64566** – 14.1 grams Impact Melt Breccia
