#### **Introduction**

60635 was collected as a rake sample near the LM (see section on 60600). It is a vesicular fine-grained impact melt.

#### **Petrography**

60645 has an unusual coloration (figure 1). The matrix is vesicular and has a variable texture (figure 2). Some areas are poikilitic, others are subophitic. There is at least one large and perhaps other small anorthosite clasts.

#### **Chemistry**

None

### **Radiogenic age dating**

None

#### **Processing**

There is only one thin section.
