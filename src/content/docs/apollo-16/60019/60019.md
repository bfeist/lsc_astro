# **Introduction**

Lunar sample 60019 is a dark glassy-matrix breccia with several large white clasts. It is found to have high 40Ar/38Ar and excess fission Xe, so it has been classified as an "ancient regolith breccia" (McKay et al. 1986), although there is no date given.

One side (the top) of 60019 has numerous micrometeorite craters (figure 1). The other side of 60019 was covered with a thick vesicular glass coat and apparently protected from meteorite bombardment (figure 2). It may have been a glass-covered bomb.

# **Petrography**

Lunar sample 60019 is a clast-rich coherent regolith breccia (Ryder and Norman 1980, Fruland 1983). The maturity is low (Is/FeO = 0.2 (McKay et al. 1986)). However, Bernatowitz et al. (1978) and McKay et al. (1986) found it to have high concentrations of rare gases, with excess 129Xe.

McKay et al. (1986), Simon et al. (1988), Korotev (1996), Takeda et al.(1988) and Pieters and Taylor (1989) have all given descriptions of the matrix of 60019. Simon et al. noted that it contained brown glass.

# **Mineralogy**

Mineral compositions (plagioclase, pyroxene and olivine) can be found in Takeda et al. (1988) and in Pieters and Taylor (1989). Trace element analyses for plagioclase and pyroxene were reported by Steele et

al. (1980) and Takeda et al. (1988). A minor amount of "rust" is reported by Hunter and Taylor (1981).

# **Significant Clasts**

60019 has numerous large white clasts which were nicely mapped and described by Galindo (1985). Takeda et al. (1987, 1988) have reported on several of

the smaller clasts (termed WF-1, WF-4 and WC-1). They are feldspathic and poikilitic in texture. In addition, Galindo (1985) identified two small basalt clasts.

Pieters and Taylor (1989) have also studied small clasts in 60019 (by combined mineralogy and spectroscopy). They were mostly feldspathic "impact melts", with various proportions of minerals (termed clasts A, B, D, G and R).

#### *Clast 1 (WC-1)(about 3 cm)*

According to Ryder and Norman (1980) the large white clast seen in figures 1 and 12 has a poikilitic texture and is made up of "granoblastic impactites, cataclastic anorthosite and aluminous basalt". Rose et al. (1975) reported the chemical composition (table 1), which does not appear to be greatly different from that of the matrix of the bulk breccia. Takeda et al. (1988) reported pyroxene and plagioclase compositions. Thin section numbers of this clast include ,77 ,78 ,81 ,82 and ,207. A portion of this rock can be seen in figure 3.

#### *Clast 2 (WC-2)(about 4 cm)*

Figures 1 and 8 show that this clast is probably several clasts adjacent to each other. They have not been studied.

# *Clast III:*

See figure 17. TS ,79 ,80

#### *Clast IV:*

See figure 17. TS ,83 ,84

#### *Ba-2: Basalt*

A small basalt clast is illustrated in figures 7 and 12. Takeda et al. (1987) reported analyses of the pyroxene (figure 8) and plagioclase (An ) in this clast. 95-98

# *Truly White*

See figure 1. This 5 mm truly white clast (dedicated to Paul Warren) on butt end ,5, needs to be studied (by him).

# **Chemistry**

Rose et al. (1975), McKay et al. (1986), Simon et al. (1988) and Korotev (1996) obtained similar results (table 1). The glass coating is also similar (figure 9).

Moore and Lewis (1976) reported high carbon and nitrogen contents for the matrix of 60019 (162 ppm and 56 ppm) and one clast (110 ppm and 28 ppm) respectively (figure 10). It also has high Ni, Ir and Au (Simon et al 1988). All this data indicates that 60019 should be considered as a soil breccia.

# **Other Studies**

Rare gases are reported in McKay et al. (1986) and Bernatowitz et al. (1978). This sample has excess 129Xe from extinct 129I., as well as "excess fission Xe" and high 40Ar/38Ar (indicators of implantation of an ancient component).

# **Processing**

Three slabs were cut through the middle of 60019 (see figures 1 and 11). The first slab was cut in 1974 and the other two in 1984 (Galindo 1985). Butt end (,4) fell to pieces (figure 16). There are 43 thin sections of 60019. The study of clasts in 60019 has not been well coordinated. Few have been analyzed and none have been dated.
