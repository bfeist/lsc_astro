# **Introduction**

Three cores were taken about 50 m apart at the ALSEP station near the LM – the deep drill string 60007 – 60001, and two double drive tubes 60010/60009 and 60014/60013 (Sutton in Ulrich et al. 1981). However, "few, if any, modal variations are stratigraphically correlatable" between these three, nearly adjacent, cores (Simon et al. 1978). The soil in this area was loosely compacted and the cores were easy to obtain, probably because of numerous small craters in the vicinity. It had been hoped that material (distinct layers) from both North Ray and South Ray craters could be identified in these cores. However, gardening of the regolith seems to have obliterated distinct layering (Arnold 1975) and no correlation of layering could be found between the three nearly adjacent cores.

The deep drill string was separated into two sections of three stems each on the lunar surface (60007, 60006 and 60005) and (60004, 60003, 60002 and 60001bit).

Apparently a substantial amount soil material fell out of the upper section, because much of 60005 and some of 60006 was found to be partially void on return to Houston. The top section (60007) was only half full (Horz et al. 1972 and Duke and Nagle 1976 offer various explanations for this).

Excerpt(s) from Horz et al. (1972), page 7-52: *"The deep drill stem (60001 to 60007) was taken approximately 175 m southwest of the LM and 25 m south of the ALSEP site in a generally flat spot in an area of rolling topography with numerous 2- to 6-m craters and relatively loose, uncompacted soil. Two other core samples and soil from seven penetrometer stations were taken within 100 m of the drill stem, which enables the most detailed correlation and reconstruction of lunar soil strata to date*". - - - - - Based on X-radiographs: *"The surficial 15.7 cm of the drill stem is relatively fine grained, contains an abundance of glass, and has been subdivided into four subunits. Of these, the uppermost 2 cm is relatively dark and crumbly and is underlain by a 3.5 cm zone that is high in whitish aggregates. Indistinct massive bedding characterizes the next 10 cm, with a rock concentration at 10.5 cm marking a break in bedding. The massive zone tends to be poorly sorted and*

*contains a coarse fraction dominated by glass fragments, droplets and feldspar fragments. The lowest 6.4 cm of section 60007 is reverse graded and coarse grained and contains a diversity of rock fragment types. The Xradiographs indicate that the coarse material at the base of section 60007 continues into section 60006 into the regolith for a total of approximately 50 cm. Bedding is thicker and more massive toward the top of this coarse-grained interval, but there are more large semiopaque rock fragments in the thinner beds at he base of the zone".* - - - - (part of 60006 and all of 60005 were partially void) - - - - *"The basal sections of the drill stem are fine grained in comparison to the upper sections. The top 11 cm of 60004 is very fine grained, followed by 25 cm of lumpy coarse material with a few distinct rock fragments. The basal 85 cm of the drill string is fine grained with a rock layer only in the middle of section 60003 at a depth of about 135 cm below the lunar surface."* 

Meyer and McCallister (1977) and Papike et al. (1982) review all of the data for the Apollo 16 deep drill and discuss the various stratigraphic layers and whether the boundaries between layers are "*ancient lunar surfaces*" or not. The discontinuity between layers A

and B at 190 cm may be a time horizon based on track studies and He and Ar isotopes, and the C/D contact at 13 cm may also be a fossil surface (discussed below). There does not appear to be complete agreement between workers from various disciplines, but it does appear that there are distinct variations along the deep drill. It is also apparent that accumulation of locally derived highlands material took place over about a billion years.

# **Petrography**

Gose and Morris (1977) determined the maturity along the deep drill (figures 2 and 3) and discussed the depositional history. They seem to have verified the "contacts" (A/B, C/D) distinguished by Vaniman et al. (1976) based on detailed petrographic analysis of thin sections. Unit A (from 190 to 225 cm) is immature and is distinguished by an abundance of large lithic clasts and abundant yellow glass. Unit B contains fewer large lithic clasts, but has a larger proportion of green glass. Unit C contains abundant large plagioclase fragments and lack orange glass. Unit D has fewer mafic mineral fragments and fewer glasses than the rest of the core.

Vaniman et al. (1976) provide an abundance of modal mineralogy for the whole drill string and distinguish four separate units (see table). In thin sections #60002,386 they found 3.7% agglutinate, #60003,242 = 10.2% agglutinate, #60007,246 = 4.1% agglutinate, but in general they did not find many agglutinates considering the mature-submature nature of the core as indicated by Is/FeO. However, Heiken et al. (1973) found 30-50% agglutinates in the top of the core (90-

150 micron splits) and there is a significant lack of agreement between agglutinate counts from bulk sample and thin section petrography. Meyer and McCallister (1977) also conclude that there are four major units.

Out of more than 300 glass particles in the deep drill, Naney et al. (1976) found 4-5 small green glass particles with high-alumina, silica-poor content (HASP). They were found distributed throughout the drill core, and it is thought that they formed by some sort of volatilization, condensation process.

Delano (1975) carefully studied mare basalt fragments from 60003 and was able to relate them to their apparent source – Mare Nectaris, 100 km to the south.

Carter (1975) and Haggerty (1978) reported on an unusual *Rusty Particle* found in 60002. This iron particle was encrusted with feathery growths of FeOOH. And it was found inside of a deep drill segment where it was well protected from terrestrial contamination.

# **Buried Surface ?**

Duke and Nagle (1974), Bogard and Hirsch (1975), Vaniman et al. (1976), Blanford and Morrison (1976), and Heymann et al. (1978) studied an apparent buried surface at about 190 cm – in drill core section 60002. The unit (A) below this boundary is immature (figure 3) and has been found to have a distinctly different isotopic composition for rare gas (Bogard and Hirsch 1975) and nitrogen (Becker and Clayton 1977). Blanford and Wood (1978) reevaluated whether this contact was an ancient regolith or a simple depositional boundary. If it is an ancient surface, it has a model

exposure age of 3-7 x 106 years and a reworking depth of 0.5 cm.

# **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of the Apollo 16 deep drill is relatively homogeneous for its entire length (Korotev 1982, 1991), with no chemically distinct layers apparent. Nava et al. (1973 and 1976), Philpotts et al. (1973), Boynton et al. (1976) and Gold et al. (1977) and Ehmann et al. (1977) also analyzed various portions the deep drill core. This data is summarized in tables 1 and 2 and figures 5 and 6. The detailed chemical composition of the Apollo 16 deep drill is found in an appendix to the paper by Korotev (1991).

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Nishiizumi et al. (1976), Fruchter et al. (1977) and Evans et al. (1980) determined the cosmic ray induced activity of 26Al and 53Mn in the Apollo 16 deep drill (figures 8 and 9). Fireman et al. (1973) reported data for the isotopic composition of Ar (figure 10).

Wieler et al. (1982) carefully studied the isotopic composition of noble gases in plagioclase separates and determined that the ratio of the Ne component from solar flares and the solar wind was distinctly different for the bottom of the Apollo 16 deep drill core.

Russ (1973) reported the neutron stratigraphy.

# **Other Studies**

The substantial amount of cosmogenic rare gas that is found throughout the Apollo 16 drill core indicates that fresh ejecta from North Ray and South Ray craters is not a significant component of the core (Bogard and Hirsch 1975). Values of 4 He/20Ne, 20Ne/36Ar and 40Ar/ 36Ar from the lowest 35 cm of the core (unit A) are distinct from all other portions of the core and from all Apollo 16 soils except 61220. Heymann et al. (1978) also report noble gas measurements for the deep drill.

Becker and Clayton (1977) found that the nitrogen isotope ratio in the coarse-grained unit at the bottom of the Apollo 16 drill (unit A?) was very light (figure 11) and concluded that the flux and the isotopic ratio of solar wind nitrogen has changed significantly over time (see Clayton and Thiemens 1980).

Behrmann et al. (1973), Price et al. (1975) (figure 7), Goswami et al. (1976), Fleischer et al. (1974), Blanford and Morrison (1976), Blanford and Wood (1978), Crozaz and Dust (1977), Crozaz (1978) and Wieler et al. (1982) all studied cosmic ray tracks in various portions of the Apollo 16 deep drill. Indeed, considerable effort has been expended trying to understand what the track data tell us, and various authors identify various layers in the core based on track data.

Crozaz (1978) explained: *"there is a basic difference in philosophy on the part of people who advocate slow accumulation (mainly researchers working with tracks) and emplacement of big slabs (essentially Morris and Gose). Slow accretion (mm to cm layers) should be common compared to occasional large depositions just because the frequency of impacts decreases steeply as the size of the impacting body (and its ejecta blanket) increases. This is precisely what trackologists deduce from their studies: they have seen repeated evidence for the deposition of small layers (mm to cm) and occasional evidence for the deposition of a much larger layer (for example the coarse-grained layer in the Apollo 17 drill stem). It is not clear to this author that the ferromagnetic resonance data cannot be interpreted in the same way. The data also show variations on a mm to cm scale which could reflect the slight maturity variations of successive thin layers of local origin."* 

Banerjee et al. (1977) reported the natural remanant magnetization (NRM) of the bottom of the drill core (60004-60002) and *tentatively* ascribe variation in the stable NRM to fluctuations in the magnetic field of the moon over time! *(however, this is considered unlikely)*

# **Processing**

The collection of the Apollo 16 core is described in the Preliminary Science Report for Apollo 16 and by Horz et al. (1972). Carrier (1974) and Allton and Waltz (1980) have presented the depth calculations of the core (figure 12). Fryxell and Heiken (1974) and Nagle and Duke (1974) have discussed how the samples were dissected and prepared. After dissection was complete the core segments (except 60005) were impregnated and encapsulated in epoxy in order to make thin sections. A reference section was preserved for future reference – see photomozaic attached. (Note: the different segments were photographed at different magnifications). Segment 60004 may be upside down!

According to the core catalog (Duke and Nagle 1976) page 16-34, some sort of bad spill occurred for sample vials of 60007 – after dissection (I wish I had a picture!).
