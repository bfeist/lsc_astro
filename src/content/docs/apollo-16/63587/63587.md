### **Introduction**

63587 was collected as a rake sample from the flank of North Ray Crater, Apollo 16 – see section on 63500. It is a coherent impact melt breccia with a poikilitic texture and numerous clasts (figure 1). It has numerous micrometeorite craters on its surface.

#### **Petrography**

63587 was described by Ryder and Norman (1980) as a "*vesicular impact melt*". It has large interlocking pyroxene oikocrysts with enclosed plagioclase crystals and ilmenite crystals concentrated in the interoikocryst areas (figure 2). Lithic clasts include cataclstic anorthosite and one large granoblastic dunite (Ryder and Norman 1980).

The compositional variation of Apollo 16 impact-melt rocks is discussed by Korotev (1994).

#### **Chemistry**

None

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

None

#### **Processing**

There are two thin sections.
