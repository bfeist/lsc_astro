The research on 65015 was well summarized in the catalog by Ryder and Norman (1980). The age of 65015 is 3.85 b.y. and its exposure to cosmic radiation is about 400 m.y.

#### **Petrography**

65015 is a feldspathic impact melt rock characterized by a well developed poikilitic texture in which oikocrysts of pyroxene enclose abundant clasts and chadocrysts (figures 2-4). Most, but not all, of the chadocrysts are plagioclase. Albee et al. (1973) also report numerous relict lithic fragments as clasts in 65015. Samples 62235 and 60315 are similar rocks.

Large interlocking oikocrysts of pyroxene (up to 0.6 mm) dominate the texture (figures 2-4). Boundaries between the oikocrysts are characterized by lath-shaped plagioclase intergrown with granular olivine and accessory ilmenite, Fe-Ni metal, troilite, phosphates and K-feldspar. The ilmenite (0.2 mm) occurs in chains

The rock has a high content of trace elements and meteoritic siderophiles (Ni, Ir, Au). Wasson et al. (1975) found that the ratios of siderophile elements in metal grains separated from the rock were different from those in the bulk rock.

The distinctive poikilitic texture of this rock, the inclusion of relict lithic and mineral clasts and the high meteoritic siderophile content are also common features of the Apollo 17, Boulder 6 samples as well as the melt sheets found in large terrestrial craters. Simonds et al. (1976) modeled the formation of these rocks as a mix of impact melt and cold clastic material.

the bulk sample.

#### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Relict, partially reacted, olivine grains (Fo65 <sup>74</sup>) are reported by Albee et al. (1973)

*Pyroxene:* Albee et al. (1973) determined the chemical composition of pyroxene in 65015 (figure 5). The

low-Ca pyroxene occurs as large oikocrysts and is generally homogenous. The high-Ca pyroxene is found in the intergranular regions and in clasts and is somewhat variable in composition.

**Plagioclase:** Abundant plagioclase grains (up to 1.5 mm) occur as chadocrysts throughout the rock and are found to be very calcic (An<sub>93-95</sub>). Laths of plagioclase (An<sub>85-90</sub>) are found in the mesostasis between the oikocrysts (figure 5). Albee et al. (1973) found that the trace FeO content of the plagioclase in the clasts was lower than for the plagioclase in the groundmass. Meyer et al. (1974) found that the trace element (Li, Ba etc.) content of the plagioclase phenocrysts was well below the level expected for plagioclase in equilibrium with the bulk rock content. Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1972) also showed that the plagioclase was not in isotopic equilibrium (figure 9).

*Ilmenite:* Ilmenite occurs as irregular poikilitic grains intergrown with other minor phases in the mesostasis (figure 7). It rarely has exsolution of rutile, baddeleyite and Cr-rich spinel (Albee et al. 1973).

*Metal:* El Goresy et al. (1973), Albee et al. (1973) and Misra and Taylor (1975) analyzed the Fe-metal grains (including one large ball, 400 microns) and found they were generally homogeneous 5-6% Ni, 0.2-0.3% Co, 0.12% P and 0.01 % S. Taylor et al. (1976) found that this composition did not change during annealing experiments. Wasson et al. (1975) proved an analysis of one metal sphere from 65015 (very high Ge!).

*Whitlockite:* Long needles (40 microns) of whitlockite are the only phosphate (Albee et al. 1973).

#### **Chemistry**

Hubbard et al. (1973), Haskin et al. (1973), Wanke et al. (1977) and others have analyzed 65015 (table 1). The rare earth elements are in high abundance and similar to KREEP (figure 9). The meteroritic siderophiles are relatively high (Ir > 10 ppb) indicating that this is not a pristine rock, but rather an impact melt (Krahenbuhl et al. 1973, Wanke et al. 1977) contaminated with a significant meteoritic component. Jovanovic and Reed (1976) reported small amounts of Ru and Os (3 ppb and 0.43 ppb, respectively). Wanke et al. (1977) reported a superior measurement for vanadium (36.7 ppm). Kerridge et al. (1975) reported 9 ppm carbon and some sulfur.

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

Because of the included old component, it has proven difficult to accurately date 65015. Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1972) found that the plagioclase separates were not on the isochron defined by quintessence and whole rock (figure 10). But these and various other investigators (figure 11) have concluded that 65015 was last melted or "metamorphosed" at about 3.9 b.y.

(see table). Kirsten et al. (1973), Jessberger et al. (1974) and Norman et al. (2006) all reported ages around 3.85 b.y. (figures 10 - 14).

Lugmair and Carlson (1978) determined a "model age" of 4.32 ± 0.12 b.y. by Sm-Nd. Nunes et al. (1973) found that U/Pb ages were concordant at 3.99 b.y. and that initial Pb was extremely low. Schaeffer et al. (1978, 1979) studied laser extraction of Ar.

Recently Bouvier et al. (2011) have precisely dated 65015 by U-Pb and Pb-Pb.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Kirsten et al. (1973) reported a cosmic ray exposure age of 365 ± 20 m.y. for 65015 by the 38Ar method. Jessberger et al. (1974) found it to be about 490 m.y. Bhandari et al. (1973) determined the "suntan" age as 1.2 m.y. by track studies.

#### **Other Studies**

Sato (1976) measured the in-situ oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature.

The magnetic properties were studied by Brecher (1977) , Stephenson et al. (1977)and Cisowski et al. (1983); electrical properties were determined by Olhoeft et al. (1973) and Alvarez (1977); thermal expansion by Todd et al. (1973); electron spin resonance by Tsay and Live (1974) and ultraviolet reflectance spectra by Hapke et al. (1978).

#### **Processing**

In 1972 a small slab was cut from this rock (figure 15). Allocations were also made from the small butt end. There are 58 thin sections of 65015 and some are used in the education lunar thin section sets.
