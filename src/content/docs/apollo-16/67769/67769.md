### **Introduction**

67769 is a rake sample collected from the rim of North Ray Crater – see section on 67701. It has a micropoikilitic texture indicating that it is an impact melt breccia.

### **Petrography**

Steele and Smith (1973) studied the mineral chemistry of 67769, finding that plagioclase was An85-95 and that both high-Ca and low-Ca pyroxene were present. The pyroxene forms oikocrysts that surround plagioacse inclusions. Poikilitic ilmenite and Fe-metal is found at boundaries of pyroxene oikocrysts. Figure 2 is from Ryder and Norman (1980). Soffler et al. (1981, 1985) classify it as micropoikilitic impact melt but offer no analysis and it remains unstudied (*and an opportunity for future generations*).

### **Processing**

There is one thin section.
