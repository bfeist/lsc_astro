### **Introduction**

67566 was collected from the south rim of North Ray Crater – see section on 67481.

### **Petrography**

Ryder and Norman (1980) reported that 67566 had a "granoblastic" texture (figures 2 and 4). The protolith was clearly a breccia.

### **Chemistry**

Stoffler et al. (1985) reported that the composition of 67566 was similar to other granulitic breccia samples from NRC (table and figure 5).

### **Radiogenic age dating**

67566 has been outgassed to yield ages (figure 3).

## **Processing**

There a two thin section.
