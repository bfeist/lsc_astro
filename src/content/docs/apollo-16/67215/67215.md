## **Introduction**

67215 was collected from the rim of North Ray Crater (figure 5). It is a white polymict breccia made up of mostly calcic plagioclase and a few relict lithic clasts. The sample as a whole, is made up of a mix of highland rock types (anorthosite, norite, granulite, breccia etc.). Olivine has a wide range of composition and pyroxene has coarse exsolution. Ages around 3.9 b.y. have been determined. Detailed studies are beginning to show that 67215 is not your typical ferroan anorthosite.

67215 was a grab sample that was placed in a special padded bag to protect delicate surface features (Horz et al. 1972). Indeed, it has lots of zap pits on top and bottom (figures 1 - 2).

## **Petrography**

James McGee (1987) provided a detailed petrographic description of 6 thin sections of 67215 – what follows here is mostly taken from that description. The granulated white matrix of 67215 has seriate grain size distribution (figure 4b). The average grain size is about 50 microns, but some mineral fragments up to 150 microns are present. Grains are rounded and often have shock features. The mineral mode of the matrix is about is about 80% plagioclase, with ~20% olivine and pyroxene and trace amounts of ilmenite, troilite and Ni-Fe metal. There is lots of rust according to Hunter and Taylor (1981). Finally, the matrix is well-enough sintered so that the rock holds together.

McGee found that lithic clasts make up about 20% of the rock, but reported that they are often indistinct and

grade into the matrix (figure 4a). Note the large dark grey aphanitic clasts in fine-grained white matrix (figure 3). Most clasts are about 1 mm in size with about 80 – 90 % plagioclase. About half of the clasts have "metamorphic" texture, 25% have "igneous" texture and 25% are so sheared as to not allow textural description. The relict igneous clasts have subophitic to intergranular to poikilitic texture. The metamorphictextured clasts have polygonal plagioclase and granoblastic or poilioblastic mafic minerals.

"Impact-melt rock" with intergranular texture also occur as large clasts (McGee 1987). They have more plagioclase (90%) with about 10% pigeonite and trace chromite and felsic glass. Mineral composition of the impact-melt rocks are significantly different. Plagioclase has a wide range, pyroxene and olivine is more mafic than other parts of 67215.

## *Significant Clasts*

MgGee (1987) described a "large" anorthosite clast with one grain of anorthite ~ 4 mm in size, a "large" grain of augite with coarse exsolution and a chromite inclusion.

Norman et al. (2003) identified and extracted a norite clast (67215c) with unbrecciated igneous texture that seems to match the mineral chemistry of the rest of the rock. The chemical composition also seem to match the matrix (table). However, they were not able to get concordant ages by Ar/Ar, Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd. However, the Sm-Nd data for the mafic component was spot on the ferroan anorthosite array of 4.46 b.y.

## **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Olivine has a wide range of composition which can be correlated with clast type (figure 6).

*Pyroxene:* Pyroxene also has a wide range of composition and is generally exsolved (figures 7 and 8). Floss et al. (1998) noted that the pyroxene had unusual trace element chemistry.

*Plagioclase:* Almost all plagioclase found in matrix or clasts in 67215 is An97±1. However, some plagioclase in the impact melt lithology is sodic. Floss et al. (1987) determined the trace element composition of plagioclase

#### **Transcript**

CC If you see a fist-sized igneous rock near the Rover we'll use the padded bags here, if not we'll just forget them for now.

LMP Okay. I bet you all of this stuff up here is really shocked. Does that make any difference to you? And therefore it's not going to be too hard.

CC All right, if you find a good dense one that you think has a good hard surface on it we'll go ahead and take it.

LMP We'll pick one up and give it a try anyway.

CDR I'm going to get one right here. It's too big for the padded bag.

LMP No, it'll go in. Well let's give it a go. (67235)

LMP Why don't you put it in number 6 there John, Now, let's see if I can find another one here.

CDR Okay, get a smaller one, Charlie. (67215)

LMP I'll tell you that the regolith is about an inch deep her in most places. There's just lots of rocks under this stuff. You can barely get the shovel in anywhere. Okay we got those two rocks for your padded bags, but I'm not sure they are going to do you any good they are so dust covered. I hit one with the shovel here that I've got in my hand that you just saw me pick up and it didn't break anyway so at least it's that hard.

CDR The Velcro came off both those bags and we weren't able to put them tight like they're supposed to be. We put them in the SCB.

CC Fine, let's just leave them in the SCB.

LMP Okay. They're right on top in number 6 and there're no rocks on top of them.

*Metal:* The metal in the clasts is the same as in the matrix (3.5 % Ni, 1.2 % Co). They have rusted.

# **Chemistry**

There is a trace of meteoritic siderophiles in the matrix and the clasts of 67215 (Warren et al. 1990). However, the clasts are probably *pristine* samples of the highland crust.

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Marvin et al. (1986) reported an imprecise age of ~3.75 b.y. for a clast of ferroan anorthosite in 67215 (figure 9). Norman et al. (2003) determined ages of an igneous-textured norite clast (figures 10 – 12), but they are not *concordant*.

## **Other Studies**

Cushing et al. (1999) studied grain size and pyroxene compositions to discuss equilibrium temperature (1000 deg C) of metamorphic conditions. McCallum et al. (2002) noted that 67215 was *not your typical ferroan*  anorthosite !

## **Processing**

Initially there were three picees of 67215 (,0 ,1 and ,2), separated by distinct cracks (see Ryder and Norman 198). After dusting these three pieces looked more alike than initially. For some reason, study of 67215 did not begin until 1980 (probably because it was so complicated).

There are 9 thin sections of 67215 (which is not enough).
