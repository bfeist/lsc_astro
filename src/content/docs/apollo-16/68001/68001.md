## **Introduction**

Station 8 was the closest to South Ray Crater so premission planning expected to sample a layer of material from South Ray crater on top of material derived from the Cayley formation (figure 1 and 2). However, after analysis it was concluded that the whole length of the core is Cayley.

Double drive tube 68002/1 was pushed in about 18 cm and then driven in to a depth of 69 cm with about 56 hammer blows (Mitchell et al. 1972). About 61 cm of core were returned (see section on 68002 for picture of entire core).

The bulk soil samples from the lunar surface that were taken closest to this core were 68120 and 68500.

#### **Petrography**

According to the preliminary science report (Horz et al. 1972), the lowest 22 cm of the core, called unit 1 (later called unit D), is very coarse grained. They even speculate that "the top of this zone may represent a

buried topographic surface" (page 7-43). However, this study was based on an interpretation of the Xradiograph, and was not confirmed by the study of the core after extrusion. Schwarz (1994) described the samples during dissection – see end of this section.

The maturity index along the double drive tube is shown in figure 3. The upper portion of the core is

made up of mature soil, while the bottom section is submature except for a thin zone at about 41cm which is very immature.

Korotev et al. (1997) studied thin sections of units B, C and the top of D, where they found the agglutinate count did not correlate with the zone of low maturity. Unit C is describe as bluish-grey soil and the subject of much discussion in Korotev et al., who conclude it is indeed a soil.

Schwarz (1995) and Ruzitka et al. (2000) reported on the occurrence of glassy chondrules with unique crystal formations (figure 5).

The numerous particles extracted during dissection have not been studied (some examples are shown in

figures 7 - 11. One large particle (16 g) at the top of 68002 has two thin sections.

#### **Chemistry**

Korotev et al. (1997) exhaustively analyzed 123 splits from the entire length of the double drive tube. They found that there were 5 different zones along the core, base on compositional data, and averaged the results for each zone (table 1). For a complete analysis of the regolith at this site see section on 68500.

The immature zone at about 41 cm was found to have very low Zn (figure 4).

#### **Processing**

68001 was dissected in 1993 (figure 6) and discussed in curatorial newsletters 55, 56 and 58. Compression of the core during extrusion was only minor. Some samples were split under "red light" conditions. The numerous coarse-fines have never been cataloged, nor studied.

There are three sets of thin sections along the whole core.

The following from Schwarz 1993, in Lunar News vol. 55 and 57:

*"68002 was extruded from the drive tube on Feb 17, 1993. The color was determined to be 10YR 5/1 on the Munsell color scale and no distinct color boundaries were observed during dissection. A void was present from the lunar surface to about 3.5 cm. The top 4 cm was loose and below that the soil was noticeably more coherent. Friable soil clods were abundant from 9.5 to 14.5 cm from the lunar surface.* 

*A close examination of particles > 1 mm from the first dissection pass showed that about 84% (by number) of the particles are in the 1-2 mm size range, 15% were 2-4 mm, 1% were 4-10 mm and less than 1% were > 10 mm.* 

*Lithology of the >1 mm fraction was determined by binocular microscopic examination of the particles from the first pass and is summarized as follows: 57% are various types of breccias, 15% are glasses including glass shards, agglutinates, and glass-coated breccias, 14% are dark, coherent, and often dusty, 12.5% are white or light grey (anorthositic), and about 1.5% are basalts. Sub-sample ,44 (1.395 g) a dusty, possibly metallic, irregular-shaped piece, was extracted from 7.7-8.5 cm interval. A large anorthositic (?) fragment, located at 0.4 – 3.4 cm from the lunar surface was uncovered and numbered after the completion of the third pass."* 

#### and

*"68001 was extruded on Dec 14, 1993. The length of extrusion was 34.1 cm; thus the total length of 68002/1 was 61 cm. The color of 68001 varied from 10YR 5/1 to 7/1 on the Munsell Color Scale and several distinct color boundaries were observed during dissection passes. A void at the top end extended to about 1.5 cm. At 0 to about 9 cm was a dark layer, approximately 10YR 5/1. Dark soil breccias and soil clods were abundant and varied from small at the top to larger toward the lower end of the core. Black fine-grained glassy particles are abundant as well as some glass and anorthosites. From about 9 to 12.5 cm is a layer of lighter gray soil (10YR 7/1) characterized by light gray clods/soil breccias which dominate the >1 cm fraction. Anorthosites are rare and small black glassy particles are fairly numerous. At 12.5 cm and continuing to about 15 cm is a darker slightly bluish-gray layer. The >1 mm fraction consists of all coherent particles, they are generally small black glassy pieces, and breccias with a few anorthosites and glass.. At about 15 cm the soil becomes a brownishgray color (10YR 6/1) and is noticeably loose and coarsegrained > 1 mm particles are numerous and all are coherent (no friable soil breccias). A finger of light gray material extends about two thirds of the diameter of the core at about* 

*18-18.5 cm with obvious mm-sized white fragments occurring. From about 21.5 cm and continuing to the bottom of the core is a lighter-colored zone of soil which is more coherent and whose > 1 mm portion is rich in soil breccias (both clods and coherent breccias) and black glassy finegrained fragments.* 

*A closer examination of particles > 1 mm from the first and second dissection passes showed that about 81% (by number) of the particles are in the 1-2 mm size range, 18% were 2-4 mm, and 1% were 4-10 mm or > 10 mm.* 

*Lithology of the >1 mm fraction was determined by binocular microscopic examination of the particles from the first and second passes and is summarized as follows, 47% are various types of breccias an dusty fragments which were difficult to indentify, 27% are black-fine-grained glassy fragments, about 10% are white or light gray (anorthositic), 6% are glasses, and <1% are basalts> Among the 20 large or unusual particles > 1 mm which were given sample numbers are soil breccias, black glassy fragments, white fragments, and a small soil clod with a rusty-looking spot. Three samples of about 0.5 grams each were taken under red-light conditions from the depths of approximately 10, 20 and 30 cm."*
