Lunar sample 60016 was found near the Lunar Module the size distribution of micrometeorite craters, which and collected at the end of the third EVA. It is regarded are found on all surfaces. Figure 1 nicely illustrates a as an "ancient" regolith breccia, presumably formed large glass-lined crater and its spall zone . during the period of basin formation (McKay et al. 1986). It has a light grey matrix with both light and Ridley (in Butler 1972) described rare brown "staining dark clasts. Ryder and Norman (1980) described this associated with metal". Hunter and Taylor (1981) also rock as a fragmental polymict breccia. reported rust.

### **Petrography**

Although 60016 has been studied by many investigators, it has not had an overall petrographic description. Ryder and Norman (1980) found that it was friable with a porous clastic matrix with seriate grain size from several mm downwards. It is polymict with lithic clasts including cataclastic and recrystallized anorthosite, coarse-and fine-grained poikilitic impact melt, granoblastic material, noritic anorthosite, dark matrix breccias, and several types of glass fragments in various stages of devitrification. Nearly all the dark matrix clasts are aphanitic melts.

60016 has very low maturity (Is/FeO = 0.5) and less than1 % agglutinates (McKay et al. 1986). Simon et al. (1988) also reported very little "fused regolith" component. Both McKay et al. and Simon et al. determined the mineralogic mode for 60016, but without apparent agreement (compare tables). McKay et al. did find agreement using three different techniques.

### **Mineralogy**

*Pyroxene:* Takeda et al. (1979) reported pyroxene analyses (figure 3).

*Plagioclase:* Johan and Christophie (1974) found that plagioclase was An96-98.

*Metal:* Misra and Taylor found the metallic iron grains were uniformly Ni = 6 %, Co = 0.3-0.4 %. Hunter and Taylor (1981) also reported "rust" around iron grains within 60016.

*Glass:* Wentworth and McKay (1988) found that 60016 did not contain glass with mare basalt composition, but did include glasses with KREEP, LKFM and highland basalt composition. A few of the glass **<sup>1000</sup>** particles had high Mg/Fe ratios.

## **Significant Clasts** sample/

### *White Granoblastic ,51 ,53* chondrite

Figures 9 and 10 show a large white clast (>1 cm). **<sup>10</sup>** There is an analysis of this clast by Wanke et al. (1975)(figure 5) and the granoblastic texture is **<sup>1</sup>** illustrated in figure 6. But is otherwise unstudied.

Korotev(1996) found one "unusually mafic glass *Figure 4: Bulk analysis of 60016 compared with* breccias" clast with high Sc, but low Sm (table 2, figure *Apollo 16 soil (see table 1).* 8).

### **Chemistry**

In general, analyses of the matrix of 60016 agree and **<sup>100</sup>** are similar to bulk soil (Table 1). Korotev (1996) sample/ analyzed 2 splits of matrix and ~20 clasts (figure 8). chondrite One unusually mafic glass breccia clast had high Sc, **<sup>10</sup>** but low Sm. Wanke et al. (1975) analyzed a large white clast and two REE-rich clasts (figure 5) as well as the matrix. Krahenbuhl et al. (1973) found enrichments **<sup>1</sup>** in volatile elements indicating exposure to a "fumarolic component". Jovanovic and Reed (1976) reported Ru and Os. **0.1** 

*Figure 5: Normalized rare-earth-element diagram* Goel et al. (1975) determined the nitrogen content of *for 60016 and its clasts (Simon et al. 1988 and Wanke* both light and dark lithologies of 60016 (light = 44 *et al. 1975).* ppm; dark = 22 ppm; average 30 ppm). This is significantly less than for soils.

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Weber and Schultz (1978) reported K-Ar ages of 3.8 +/- 0.1 b.y. Cohen et al. (2006, 2007) reported Ar/Ar ages for two clasts (~3.8 b.y).

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Weber and Schultz (1978) and Eugster et al. (1999) reported a cosmic ray exposure age of 2.2 +/- 0.6 m.y. (roughly South Ray Crater age?).

McKay et al. (1986) reported the rare gas content and isotopic ratios. The high 40Ar/38Ar rations and presence of "fission Xe" led these authors to conclude that it is an "ancient regolith breccia".

Adams and McCord (1973) and Charette et al. (1976) determined the optical spectra.

60016 was used for various magnetic measurements (Nagata et al. 1974, Huffman et al. 1974, Cisowski et al 1975 and others). I don't think they found anything!

### **Processing**

Fruland (1983) included 60016 in the regolith breccia guidebook. Martinez (1985) mapped the slabbed surfaces (see figures 9 – 16). There are three slabs of 60016 and 43 thin sections.

60016 has been the subject of a "consortium" led by Basu.

There are two public display samples for 60016.
