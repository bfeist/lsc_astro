#### **Introduction**

65905 is one of several dense particles found in soil sample 65901 (figures 1 and 2). The section on 65901 discusses the location of these samples.

### **Petrography**

Ryder and Norman (1980) termed 65905 "basaltic impact melt" but McKinley et al. (1983) termed it "poikilitic melt breccia". Pieces have been allocated to Randy Korotev and Larry Taylor, but they have not informed the Curator what was learned.

Hey, it's got about the best poikilitic texture I've seen (figure 4 and 5).

## **Chemistry**

McKinley et al. (1983) report the only analysis, without documentation how it was achieved..

#### **Processing**

There are 4 thin sections
