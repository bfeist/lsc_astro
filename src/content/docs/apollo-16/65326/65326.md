## **Introduction**

Although Manny Bass reported the streak of "rust" (figure 1) in the original PET Catalog (Butler 1972), it has apparently not been studied. The color photos show it to have been "bronze colored". Photos also indicate that there may be more than one lithology to the sample (?), but the sample has not been studied as a whole.

#### **Petrography**

Reports are that 65326 is almost entirely made of plagioclase with coarse-grained, clast-rich areas similar to 60516 separated by areas of predominately fine-grained, granulated material (Warner et al. 1976). The plagioclase – pyroxene composition place it in the ferroan anorthosite field (figure 5).

Warren (1994) calls it "pristine".

# **Mineralogy**

**Pyroxene:** Dowty et al. (1974) reported the pyroxene composition (figure 4).

**Plagioclase:** Warner et al. (1976) figure shows plagioclase in 65326 is  $An_{97}$ .

*Ilmenite:* Dowty et al. (1974) reported ilmenite with MgO = 4.6 - 5.3%

"Rust": Hunter and Taylor (1981) report "rust" in their extensive table.

## **Processing**

It is unlikely that a streak on the surface of this sample would not have been rubbed off - perhaps to now be found only in the processing fines. There are only two thin sections.
