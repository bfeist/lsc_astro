#### **Introduction**

67729 was collected as a rake sample from the rim of North Ray Crater – see section on 67701. It is a vesicular glass breccia with significant clasts, and has the appearance of a "glass bomb". It has zap pits on all sides. 67729 and it's clast assemblage has not been studied. It contains a basalt clast.

#### **Petrography**

Borchardt et al. (1986) studied the "glass bombs" found in and around North Ray Crater, but they seem to have overlooked this rather good example. 67729 is like an envelope of rock clasts, wrapped in glass. If it were to be a "bomb", it could have been delivered from afar.

Most glass in 67729 is devitrified, with abundant 67729 contains about 10 lithic clasts – they have not plagioclase microlites. The glass exhibits flow- been studied. banding.

# Significant clasts

#### White Clast ,4 ,14TS

This clast is chalky white and about 2 cm in dimension (figure 2 and 4). It has subophitic to granular texture with large plagioclase and about 30% yellow mafic mineral (figure 8)(Ryder and Norman 1980). Most of it remains on ,0.

#### Green Basalt Clast ,9 ,15TS

Most of this clast also remains on the parent ,0, but a number of pieces (,9,10 figure 6) were extracted. Thin section ,15 shows an ophitic basalt with a well-developed plagioclase network enclosed by olivines up to 3 mm in diameter (figures 9 and 11).

## *Off-white clast* (on B).

This white clast has vague outline, and would appear to be a cataclastic anorthosite. It has not be sectioned.

### **Processing**

First, during initial handling, a large piece (B) containing a white area broke off and a thin section ,1 was made (figure 2). It is still considered part of ,0. In 1980, the obvious clasts were sampled to make thin sections (figure 6). In 1996, additional chips were made to yield a glass sample (,19)(figure 7) and more white clasts were expsoed. The remainder of each clast still resides on A or B.
