## **Introduction**

60035 is a fine-grained, clast-rich, polymict breccia made up of clasts of ferroan anorthosite, troctolite, troctolitic anorthosite and noritic anorthosite (Ryder 1980, Warner et al. 1980). There are areas that have melted and recrystallized as well as a "matrix" that is somewhat less feldspathic than the clasts. The meteoritic siderophile content is high. It is apparently a highlands breccia, with no mare component (figure 1).

Apparently the surface of this rock was initially completely covered with a black glass coating (figure 2). The top, eroded surface is now covered with micrometeorite pits and thin brown patina (figure 3).

This sample was originally set aside as a "posterity" sample, to be studied at a later date. To date, it remains poorly characterized, and requires further study. Recently, it was dated at 4.09 ± 0.1 b.y. with an exposure to cosmic radiation for about 6 m.y.

## **Petrography**

Warner et al. (1980) performed a survey of several thin sections of 60035. They found that it was clastic in nature, with small recrystallized clasts of troctolitic anorthosite and noritic anorthosite making up about 80% of the rock. Additional clasts of cataclastic anorthosite and troctolite were studied (figure 5).

A variety of textures are observed, from equigranular, granulitic, poikilitic, annealed cataclastic, to recrystallized. All areas are feldspathic. Cushing et

al. (1999) calculated a metamorphic temperature of 1118 deg C from pyroxene pairs and termed the rock a "granulite". Hudgins et al. (2008) included 60035 in their study of granulitic breccias.

A few thin veins of shock glass are reported by Ma and Schmitt (1982) and Warner et al. (1980).

## **Significant Clasts**

*Troctolite:* At the edge of thin section 60035,21, there is a small clast (4 x 10 mm) of troctolite with mafic minerals including olivine (Fo88), orthopyroxene (En86), chromite and Ni rich metal (Warner et al. 1980).

*Ferroan Anorthosite:* Two chips from 60035 were found to have Fe-rich pyroxene and were termed ferroan anorthosite by Warner et al. (1980) and Ma and Schmitt (1982).

## **Mineralogy**

*Olivine*: Ma and Schmitt (1982) found that an "olivine clast" (troctolite?) was strongly enriched in heavy REE and had a high FeO/MnO ratio (104). Hudgins et al. (2008) reported Fo76-78. Warner et al. (1980) reported olivine in a troctolite clast was Fo88.

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase is uniformly calcic in composition (An92-97). In some areas, large grains of plagioclase enclose chains of rounded mafic minerals along their boundaries indicating overgrowth.

*Pyroxene*: The composition of pyroxene in 60035 is given in figure 4 (Warner et al. 1980). Cushing et al. (1999) determined the composition of pyroxene pairs.

*Metal:* Warner et al. (1980) found high Ni and Co in numerous metal grains in 60035 (figure 6). Hunter and Taylor (1981) reported only minor rust and schreibersite. Hudgins et al. (2008) reported Ni = 4.4 – 6.1 %

*Glass*: The black glass found attached to the surface of 60035 has been studied by See et al. (1986) and Morris et al. (1986).

*Opaques:* Ilmenite, chromite and zirconolite were reported by Hudgins et al. (2008).

*Apatite:* Apatite was reported by Hudgins et al. (2008).

#### **Summary of ages for 60035**

Ar/Ar

Hudgins et al. 2008

4.088 ± 0.1 b.y.

New decay constant

## **Chemistry**

Ma and Schmitt (1982) analyzed the white interior and the black glass and found high Ir indicating meteoritic contamination throughout (table 1). They found similarity of the white interior with materials from North Ray Crater, while the glass was similar to South Ray Crater !? Hudgins et al. (2008) determined duplicate analyses on two additional splits (figure 7).

## **Radiogenic age dating**

60035 has been dated by Hudgins et al. (2008) at 4.088 ± 0.1 b.y. using the Ar/Ar plateau technique (figure 8).

## **Cosmic ray Exposure Age**

Hudgins et al. (2008) determined a cosmic-rayexposure age of 6.4 ± 0.5 m.y.

## **Processing**

In 1980, a slab was cut through the middle of this large rock (figures 9 - 11). From its appearance, it will prove difficult to break this rock up into its original lithic clasts. A carefully organized consortium study of this posterity sample would yield further understanding of the lunar highland crust. There are currently 10 thin sections.
