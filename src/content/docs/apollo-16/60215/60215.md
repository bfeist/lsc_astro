### **Introduction**

60215 is actually a polymict breccia, because it apparently contains clasts of material other than anorthosite. However, the largest portion is almost pure white and very plagioclase rich (figures 9 and 10). The anorthositic portion is both highly shocked and cataclastic (figures 4 and 6).

The analysis of 60215 shows it has very little Ni, Co nor carbon, so that the main portion of 60215 is considered "pristine". It has not been dated, but an exposure age to cosmic ray of 2.3 m.y. has been determined. The rock was apparently originally encased in black glass (figure 2), which has been eroded or chipped away by micrometeorite bombardment.

### **Petrography**

Meyer and McCallister (1973) and Dixon and Papike (1975) have reported on the petrography of 60215 and analyzed the mineral compositions. McGee (1993) reported: *"This cataclastic anorthosite is highly shocked and has numerous, brown mottled fragments of plagioclase composition (probably devitrified maskelynite) that contain abundant, minute (<1 mm) mafic inclusions. Plagioclase fragments are relatively coarse (2-3 mm). Pyroxene fragments are rare and are generally less than 0.1 mm across, except for one texturally distinctive millimeter-size, shocked and strongly zoned pigeonite clast. This pigeonite clast is relatively Mg rich and strongly zoned in Mg and Fe content (Wo15En69 to Wo20En55), has granular exsolution due to partial inversion, and has minor intergrown olivine (Fo67). A second, smaller fragment adjacent to*

*this pigeonite is extremely Fe rich (Wo20En55). These two zoned pyroxene fragments appear to be exotic and are not included in the data tabulations. Low-Ca pyroxene compositions are heterogeneous; subordinate high-Ca pyroxene is more homogeneous. Compositions agree with previous studies. Rare chromite and olivine are present."* 

Another exotic material found within 60215 is represented small inclusions of "troctolitic basalt" (figures 7 and 8).

Warren (1993) argued that at least a portion of this sample is "pristine". Hunter and Taylor (1981) found no rust.

### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Dixon and Papike (1975) give a complete analysis of an olivine xenocryst (Fo78).

*Pyroxene:* Bersch et al. (1991) give precise analyses of pyroxene. Ishii et al. (1976) calculated an equilibrium temperature of 1005 deg. C using the pyroxene data from Dixon and Papike (figure 4 a,b). Other grains of zoned pyroxene are found as xenocrysts.

Rose et al. (1975) provide the only analysis of 60215. The REE have not been reported except for the glass (which has nothing to do with the interior anorthosite).

Moore and Lewis (1976) and Cripe and Moore (1975) reported C = 17 ppm and N = 105 ppm.

## **Radiogenic age dating**

None

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Eugster (1999) determined the cosmic ray exposure age of 60215 to be 2.31 ± 0.5 m.y. by the 38Ar method.

# **Processing**

60215 broke into subequal parts during PET along the existing penetrating fracture(figures 2 and 9). A large interior chip (,10) was pure white material (figure 10). There are 10 thin sections of 60215, but most of the thin sections are from a piece that broke off initially.

So, apparently, 60215 has not been sawn (and that's a good thing – call me, if you want to know why).
