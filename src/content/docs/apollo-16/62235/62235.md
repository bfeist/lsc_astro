# **Introduction**

62235 was found sitting half-exposed on the lunar surface at station 2 on the rim of Buster Crater. It was collected along with soils 62230 and 62240 and adjacent samples. The exposed surface of 62235 had numerous micrometeorite craters, while the bottom side did not (figure 1).

62235 is an apparently homogeneous, coherent, hollocrystaline impact melt rock with classic poikilitic texture (figures 2 and 3). It is highly enriched in trace elements and siderophile elements and has been dated at 3.88 b.y., with an exposure history of 153 m.y.

This lunar sample was found by Collinson et al. (1973) to be magnetized in a strong field (1.3oerstad) with consistent directional orientation (confirmed by independent measurements by Sugiura and Strangway 1983).

analysis of the mineral chemistry. They reported olivine cores, rimed by orthopyroxene and finally high-Ca pyroxene.

McGee et al. (1979) provided an elegant interpretive description: "Sample 62235 is a clast-bearing impactmelt breccia characterized predominantly by coalescing oikocrysts of orthopyroxene enclosing laths of plagioclase. Poikilitic ilmenite (with included plagioclase tablets) and small amounts of phosphate, Fe-Ni metal, troilite and K-spar are concentrated between the oikocrysts. Mineral clasts, dominantly plagioclase, together with less commonly occurring lithic clasts are scattered randomly throughout the sample. Irregularly shaped vugs (up to 0.6 mm) are relatively common; spherical vesicles (typically 0.25 mm and less) are also present but are less dominant." "Orthopyroxene oikocrysts typically display rectangular outlines (up to 2 mm in length) although round and irregular shapes are also present. Oikocrysts are commonly observed to have grown around spherical

## **Petrography**

62235 is a quilt-like patchwork of intergrown pyroxene oikocrysts with olivine cores and enclosing numerous small laths of plagioclase (compare with 60315 and 65015). Ilmenite and accessory phases have been concentrated at the boundaries of the pyroxene patches (figure 2 and 3). Crawford and Hollister (1974) discussed the petrography of 62235 and presented a two-stage crystallization sequence from detailed vesicles. Plagioclase is present as anhedral or tabletshaped crystals (0.01-0.05 mm) and as lath-shaped crystals (both enclosed within orthopyroxene oikocrysts and located between the oikocrysts."

"Ilmenite is the dominant opaque phase, occurring as poikilitic crystals (up to 0.4 mm), typically with silicate inclusions, which occur interstitial to orthopyroxene oikocrysts. Rare, needle-like laths of ilmenite (0.025 0.05 mm) are present and occur in association with poikilitic ilmenite grains. Troilite and Fe-Ni metal occur as micron size blebs or irregularly shaped crystals also in association with poikilitic ilmenite. Irregularly shaped troilite grains may be as large as 0.25 mm."

"Plagioclase clasts are present as subangular to subrounded grains (up to 0.6 mm) enclosed within and interstitial to orthopyroxene oikocrysts. The clasts are typically unfractured and rarely display twinning. Lithic clasts constitute a small percentage (typically <10%) of the total clast population in samples 62235. Basaltic clasts are present and typically display ophitic textures. One small anorthosite clast was observed in section 62235,39; no breccias clasts were observed."

#### **Mineralogy**

*Plagioclase:* Meyer et al. (1974) determined that the Ba content of plagioclase clasts in 62235 was too low for them to have reached equilibrium with the high Ba melt.

*Pyroxene:* The majority of the abundant pyroxene is low-Ca (figure 4).

*Ilmenite:* von Englehardt (1979) determined the crystallization history of ilmenite.

*Metal:* Metal grains are large and abundant in 62235. Pearce et al. (1974) determined the Ni and Co contents (figure 5). Hunter and Taylor (1981) found little rust nor schreibersite.

#### **Chemistry**

Clark and Keith (1973), Brunfeldt et al. (1973), Hubbard et al. (1973), Laul et al. (1974) and Wanke et al. (1976) all reported chemical analyses for 62235 (table). In fact, the broad agreement of their analyses on this homogeneous rock, shows that the chemical analyses on rather small amounts of lunar material, in the 1970s, were of high accuracy. What they found was that this sample had lots of KREEP (figure 6). It also has very high Ni, Ir, Au, Re and W.

Moore et al. (1973) reported that 62235 had very low carbon content (2 ppm). Garg and Ehmann (1976) precisely determined Zr and Hf in 62235 and other Apollo samples.

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Norman et al. (2006) determined the age (figure 7). Nyquist et al. (1973) and Tera et al. (1974) determined the Rb and Sr isotopic composition. Kleine et al. (2005) and Touboul et al. (2007) reported on the isotopic composition of tungsten.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Drozd et al. (1974) and Pepin et al. (1974) give the exposure age (38Ar = 153 m.y., 81Kr = 153.3 m.y.). Clark and Keith (1973) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 22Na = 50 dpm/kg, 26Al = 137 dpm/kg, 56Co = 13 ± 13 dpm/kg. and 46Sc = 3 dpm/kg.

# **Other Studies**

measurements by Sugiura and Strangway 1983). Chung and Westphal (1973) determined "dielectric spectra" and other physical parameters.

The size-frequency distribution of microcraters was determined by Morrison et al. (1973) and Neukum et al. (1973)(figure 8). McDonnell et al. (1976) used 62235 for experiments with secondary crater production.

### **Processing**

The section on 62235 in Ryder and Norman (1980) contains additional information.

A thin slab (0.5 cm) was cut through the middle of 62235 (figures 9-11). There are 9 thin sections of 62235 (perhaps not enough). *Please be aware that rocks with abundant saw marks may have been substantially heated at the area near the saw cut.*
