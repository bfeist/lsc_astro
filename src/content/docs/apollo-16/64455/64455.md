### **Introduction**

Sample 64455 has proven to be a nearly perfect sample for studies of the effects of comic ray, solar comic ray and micrometeorite bombardment of the lunar surface over the last 2 My, because it apparently maintained its orientation since it landed and been continuously exposed to the space environment for that time.

64455 is an egg-shaped object about 5 cm long and 3 cm across (figure 1) almost completely covered with thick black glass. The inside "yoke" is a fragment of basaltic melt rock, which is exposed in one quadrant on the top where the glass has broken off. The top surface is almost completely covered with micrometeorite craters, while the bottom surface has none, indicating that the sample has maintained its orientation since it landed on the lunar surface (figure 2).

### **Petrography**

Sample 64455 is a basaltic impact melt with very thick glass coat (Ryder and Norman 1980). Grieve and Plant (1973) describe four texture zones (a) interior fractured highland basalt, (b) basalt with interstitial partial melt, (c) a thin crust of brown devitrified glass, and (d) an outer coating of fresh glass (figure 3). Vaniman and Papike (1980) group the crystalline highland basalt interior fragment with the Low-K Fra Mauro suite and give the mineralogical mode as 59.9 vol. % plagioclase, 32.7 % pyroxene, 6.5 % olivine (with trace metal, troilite, schreibersite and "rust").

### **Mineralogy**

The composition of pyroxene, olivine and plagioclase of the interior rock fragment are presented in Vaniman and Papike (1980) and Heiken et al. (1991) (figures 4 and 5). The composition of schreibersite and metal

grains are given in Grieve and Plant (1973), who also mention several metal grains showing alteration to a "rusty" component.

### **Chemistry**

Haskin et al. (1973) determined the major and trace element chemistry of the glass and interior rock fragment (table 1 and figure 6) and note that the glass can not simply be derived from the included rock fragment. Ganapathy et al. (1974) determined the trace and volatile composition and note that the volatile-rich glass may be from South Ray Crater (confirmed by Hertogen et al. 1977). The composition of the glass splashed on the outside of the rock has also been studied by See et al. (1986) and Morris et al. (1986).

The interior rock fragment does not appear to be "pristine" (Ir = 2.25 ppb).

### **Radiogenic age dating**

None

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

The 81Kr exposure age of 64455 is 2.01 m.y. and the rock is associated with the South Ray cratering event

(Marti 1975, as reported by Arnold et al. 1993). Bogard and Gibson (1975) reported a 21Ne cosmic ray exposure age of 1.2 m.y. and 36Ar age of 1.8 m.y.

Nishiizumi et al. (1995) determined the 10Be, 26Al (figure 7) and 36Cl activity by accelerator mass spectrometry of 19 sub-samples along a depth profile in 64455,82 (slab B). The distribution of microcraters and the 10Be activity are consistent with exposure of 64455 to cosmic rays for only 2 m.y. (Nishiizumi et al. 1995).

Arnold et al. (1993) also determined the 10Be, 26Al and 36Cl as a function of depth below the surface of the protected side of 64455,82, by grinding away (peeling) thin surfaces with a drill.

### **Other Studies**

Neukum et al. (1973) studied the distribution of micrometeorite craters (figure 8). Blanford et al. (1974, 1975) studied the nuclear tracks (figure 9) and present a figure illustrating the lunar orientation (figure 10).

Leich et al. (1973) determined the depth distribution of H and F in exterior chips. Goldberg et al. (1976) attempted to determine solar wind implanted carbon.

### **Processing**

Two slabs have been cut from top to bottom of 64455 (figure 11). Slab A was prepared in 1972 (figure 12). Slab B was cut in 1992 (figure 13). Figure 14 illustrates the saw cuts on the T1 surface.

Luckly, non of these impacts was large enough to disturb the orientation, although one may have been big enough to break the glass coating, exposing the interior rock sample. The uppermost surface was saturated with small craters (Neukum et al 1973). A few microcraters can also be seen on the exposed rock surface.*

Note: The initial PET photography (with the sample in an upside down orientation, resting on the zap-pitted surface, figure 1) established the orientation cube with the B1 surface being the zap-pitted surface. This has caused a lot of confusion.
