#### **Introduction**

67756 is a rake sample collected from the rim of North Ray Crater – see section on 67701. It is a plagioclaserich breccia, with minerals that seem to have equilibrated – hence it is called "recrystallized".

#### **Petrography**

This small chalky white particle was described by Ryder and Norman (1980) and analyzed by Steele and Smith (1973), but it is of no importance.

#### **Chemistry**

None

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Not

### **Processing**

One thin section.
