#### **Introduction**

69935 was chipped from the top of a 0.5 meter boulder at station 9, Apollo 16 – see picture in 69955. The top surface is covered with micrometeorite pits (figures 1 and 2), and this rock has been used to understand the flux of micrometeorites and erosion of boulder surface over the past 2 m.y. However, the exposure age obtained for the top of this boulder is not consistent with that of the sample from the bottom (69955), nor the data from track studies. No fillet has developed

around the boulder so it is thought to have been recently set out on top of the regolith (Sutton 1981).

The case for this to represent the age of the cratering event at South Ray crater is made by Eugster (1999).

#### **Petrography**

69935 is an apparently a polymict breccia that is texturally inhomogeneous (Ryder and Norman 1980). It contains a rather large white clast (figure 1, 3, 4). The matrix of 69935 appears to be that of a soil breccia

#### Transcript

*The astronauts were doing several things at once, but the comments pertaining to sampling the small boulder are as follow:* 

LMP We can turn this rock over. If you want us to get that sample in, we need an extension.

CC All right.

LMP John, you want to start sampling while I do that. Can you turn that over by yourself/

CDR Well, I'm going to give it a go.

LMP Getting a sample off of it, John?

CDR Yeah (69935). The top of that rock is hard breccia, and I'm just going to throw it under your seat, Charlie.

LMP He did it, Houston! He did it.

CC So you can not only sneak up on them, you can flip them over, huh?

CDR Yeah. That's a biggie. Man. It looks like it been sitting there for quite a while. Look at that soil underneath.

CC Right. A chip off of the bottom and the soil will probably do it.

CDR A chip off the bottom.

LMP I see a place where we can get a chip off the bottom. The bottom is glass covered, Houston. Yeah, white glass.

CRD No, the black stuff is the glass. That other is the crystal. That's a crystalline rock. (69955)

CC Now you found a real rock.

LMP Aha! Look at that piece here, let me get it John, Back up. I'll go get it. There it is right there.

CRD Can you pick it up with your shovel?

LMP I don't want to get it too dirty. Okay, we got you about a 4 cm chip. That's not glass, John. Those are crystals. Those are big crystals. At least 5 mm, with a bluish cast to them.

CDR That's going in bag 380, Houston. It looks to me like it's a shocked rock with a lot of - and this is a guess – a lot of black glass in the fractures.

(figures 3 and 5). However, the mineralogy of this sample has generally not been documented by petrologists. There are no mineral analyses.

Metal grains in 69935 are rusted (Misra and Taylor 1975).

#### **Significant Clast**

#### *Anorthosite Clast:*

A large white "clast" of anorthosite (1 x 2 cm) is exposed on the top, bottom and east end (E1) of the sample (figures 3 and 4). It has apparently not been studied.

#### **Mineralogy**

*Metal:* The only "mineral" that has been studied in 69935 is the Fe-Ni-Co metal grains. Taylor et al. (1976) performed annealing experiments on these grains to show that they can be significantly modified by heating – as in an ejecta blanket (figure 14).

#### **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of the matrix of 69935 is rather similar to Apollo 16 soil (*either the boulder was made of soil, or the soil was made from the boulder*). There is a high abundance of meteoritical siderophile elements (Ir, Au etc). The REE data in Laul and Schmitt (1973) are inconsistent with their plot, indicating a misprint (figure 7).

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Behrmann et al. (1973) and Drozd et al. (1974) reported cosmic ray exposure ages of 81Kr = 1.99 and 21Ne = 1.4 m.y. - which is interpreted to be the age of South Ray Crater. The case for this to represent the age of the cratering event at South Ray crater is made by Eugster (1999).

Rancitelli et al. (1973) determined the cosmic ray induced activity of 22Na = 50 dpm/kg., 26Al = 159 dpm/ kg. and Fruchter et al. (1981) 53Mn = 135 dpm/kg. for 69935. Bhandari (1975) determined the activity of 26Al = 300 ± 140 dpm/kg. for a surface sample.

#### **Other Studies**

69935 was used for the study of micrometeorite pits (Morrison et al. 1973, Neukum et al. 1973, Fechtig et al. 1974 (figures 8 and 9). Nagel et al. (1975) studied the ratio of the diameter to depth of microcraters on the surface of 69935 and compared them with other samples (figure 10). Bhandari (1977) determined a cosmic ray track density/depth profile of feldspar (figure 11) and calculated an exposure age of only ~ 0.5 m.y. (significantly less than Drozd et al. 1974) – explained by local variation in spallation of surface material.

#### **Processing**

A lab was cut through the middle of 69935 (figure 12) perpendicular to the lunar surface to obtain a depth profile. The slab only cut thru the matrix of the boulder and did not sample the large white clast (which remains unstudied). However, I see no evidence that this ideal depth profile was ever used for cosmic-ray, solar flare studies (SCR).

There are 10 thin sections of 69935.
