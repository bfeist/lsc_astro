## **60009 - 60010**

### Double Drive Tube ALSEP Site

### **Introduction**

This core is said to be one of the 'best studied' from the moon (Papike et al. 1982). It was collected as a double drive tube about 60 cm long and one of three collected from the Apollo 16 ALSEP site (fige 1). It was from the rim of a small (50-60 cm) shallow crater. 60009 is the lower segment, 60010 the upper. This drive tube was studied in detail instead of the deep drill, because it was less disturbed and 4 cm in diameter compared with only 2 cm for the drill core. However, it was found that "few, if any, of the modal variations in 60010/9 are stratigraphically correlatable" with the deep-drill 60001 - 60006 collected only 50 meters away (Simon et al. 1978). The same was true for a comparison with 60014 – 60013 (Korotev and Morris 1993).

Using tracks, Blanford et al. (1977) identified a buried soil boundary and profile about 50-52 cm down. It was exposed for ~6 x 106 years before the upper portion of the cores was deposited. This unit is coarse-grained and feldspathic (see below).

The upper 12.5 cm of the core has undergone *in situ*  maturation and reworking which occurred after the original mixing and deposition (Morris 1978, Papike et al. 1982). It is more mature than the rest of the core. There is also something special about the very bottom of the core.

Fruland et al. (1982) performed a complete review of all the data, although the critical detailed chemical data wasn't available until 1991.

### **Petrography**

The description of the double drive tube based on Xradiographs (Horz et al. 1972) and on initial description during dissection (Nagle et al. 1976) already indicated that there was a lot of variability in lithology of this core. Fruland et al. (1982) provide a complete description based on observations during disection.

Morris and Gose (1976), Housley et al. (1976) and Morris (1978) present the maturity as a function of

depth in the double drive tube 600010/9 and found that the top 12.5 cm was higher maturity than the rest of the core, which they attribute to modern *in situ*  reworking (gardening).

McKay et al. (1976, 1977) determined the grain size analysis and the petrological mode (Table 1), but didn't find as many agglutinates as would be indicated by the maturity index. Simon et al. (1978) also reported the mode based on a study of thin sections (see Table 2 for summary) and Vaniman et al. (1978) reported compositional data for minerals, glasses and rock fragments.

Fruland et al. (1982) provide the following description of the feldspathic unit starting at 50 cm depth, based on observations during dissection. *"Between 50 and 54 cm is the unit with the coarsest grain size in 60009/10, and one of the coarsest units in any lunar core. The matrix is relatively light-colored, and appears to consist of very irregularly-shaped two-centimeter-diameter areas of light and dark soil. These areas appear to be equidimensional,*

*but with interfingering, crenulate margins. The most distinctive characteristic of the interval is the concentration of rock fragments, which make up over 75% of the mass of the unit, and are so abundant that they form a packed, framework texture. This unit can be described as a gravel deposit with interstitial soil. Most of the rock fragments readily shed dust, and are tough, grey, fine-grained crystalline rocks. White (plagioclase) crystals also occur and are up to one cm in diameter."* 

Vaniman et al. (1978) also reported several (9) small fragments of mare basalt.

McKay et al. (1976), Gose and Morris (1976) and Goswami et al. (1976) noted at "sharp discontinuity" in petrologic character, maturity and track density near the bottom of the core (~59 cm).

Papike et al. (1982) found that there was essential agreement among the various measures of maturity and that "these sample show a wide range of maturity", "explained by mixing mature and more mature 'endmembers' soils; with three petrographic end-members required".

### **Chemistry**

Korotev (1991) has an appendix that gives a lot of data (every 0.5 cm). He finds that "*the 60009/10 core shows greater compositional variation with depth than any other lunar core".* In particular, *"the soil at 54 cm depth in 60009 is the most feldspathic yet found among Apollo 16 regolith samples; no other Apollo 16 soil is comparably poor in Sc and other elements associated with mafic mineral phases."* This same unit was also identified by Ali and Ehmann (1977). However, the

white soil at 52-55 cm does not contain as much Ir as the other soils (unit 4, table).

Blanchard et al. (1976, 1977) determined the chemical composition of various size and magnetic separates of the core (Tables 4 and 5). They found a rare-earthelement-rich layer at about 20 cm. They also found the fine fraction and the magnetic fraction were enriched in trace elements compared with the bulk samples (similar result to Papike et al. 1982).

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

the top of the core the data does not fall on the theoretical curve, hence the top has recently been disturbed by cratering or gardening within the past 10 m.y. Evans et al. (1980) use this data to calculate a regolith accumulation rate of 1-2 cm/m.y.

Bogard and Hirsch (1976, 1977) studied the noble gas evidence for a complex depositional and irradiational history of the core, requiring addition of pre-irradiated material. <sup>4</sup>He and <sup>36</sup>Ar were found to be closely coordinated with maturity. They found that the bottom of the core was deposited in the last 125 m.y.

#### **Other Studies**

Banerjee et al. (1977) have studied the remanent magnetization stratigraphy along the length of epoxy encapsulated sections of the core 60010/9.

Goswami et al. (1976), Crozaz and Dust (1977) and Blanford et al. (1977, 1979) studied the cosmic and solar ray tracks in crystals from the core (figures 8, 9 and 10). McKay et al. (1977) and Blanford et al. (1979)
