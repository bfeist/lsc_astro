## **Introduction**

60015 is a cataclastic anorthosite that is rather pure in age of about 2 m.y. (South Ray Crater?) and an Ar/Ar bulk composition. It was collected near the Lunar age of 3.5 b.y. (although it is probably older). The Module but was not "oriented" by surface photography. interior anorthosite is ferroan and chemically "pristine" It has a thick coat of glass splashed over all surfaces (Ryder and Norman 1980). *The sample was once*  except B1 (bottom). 60015 has a cosmic-ray exposure *termed "Blue Genesis" (Sutton 1981).*

# **Petrography**

The top, sides and ends of 60015 are covered with a thick coat of black glass, as if the sample was a glass covered "bomb." The bottom surface, however, has less glass (figure 3), as if it had been "chipped" or eroded away. The micrometeorite exposure history of the glass covered surface is 105 years (Mandeville 1976), while the cosmic ray exposure age of the overall rock is ~2x106 years (Leich and Niemeyer 1975). Hence, it would appear that the bottom side of 60015 was originally facing up, and about 105 years ago the rock was turned over.

The interior of 60015 is a highly-shocked ferroan anorthosite (~98% plagioclase). Dixon and Papike (1975) pictured relict "triple junction" texture between large grains of plagioclase (1 – 3 mm) with small grains of pyroxene at the junction. The plagioclase has extensive evidence of shock (patchy and undulose extinction) and melted, but maskelynite is not reported. Pyroxene grains are rounded and also show evidence of shock. Some orthopyroxene occurs as thin "strigners" along feldspar. Pyroxene aggregates in the matrix have associated ilmenite, Cr spinel and troilite. No olivine was found.

According to Sclar et al. (1973), the snow-white interior of 60015 "consists of highly strained anhedral plagioclase with a seriate grain-size distribution plus a few percent of relatively large strained euhdral to subhedral plagioclase laths up to 3 mm long set in an intergranular and interstitial groundmass of very fine aggregates of feathery plagioclase." The highlyshocked plagioclase includes bubble-like melt inclusions with a very high index of refraction. Sclar and Bauer (1974) describe many complex shock, and quench, features in 60015.

Sclar and Bauer (1974) also describe a zone of melted and recrystallized anorthosite which would require very high temperature (>1500 deg C) at some point in the history of the sample.

## **Micrometeorite craters**

The smooth glass surface on the top of 60015 provided a nice target for micrometeorites (figure 1). Neukum et al. (1973), Fechtig et al. (1974), Mandeville (1976) and Hartung et al. (1977) reported studies of the number and size distribution of zap pits on this surface (figure 10). They found that the size distribution of zap pits was different from that of other lunar samples and concluded the surface is "undersatuated" with respect

to micrometeorites and only about 10<sup>5</sup> years old. Flavill et al. (1978) show evidence that some of the microcraters may be secondary in origin.

# Mineralogy Olivine: none

**Pyroxene:** Dixon and Papike (1975) give the only detailed analyses of mafic minerals in 60015 (figure 7). Ishii et al. (1976) calculate the equilibration temperature of the pyroxene (987 C).

**Plagioclase:** Sclar et al. (1973) give the plagioclase composition as An<sub>90-95</sub>, Sclar and Bauer (1974) report An<sub>95-98</sub> and Dixon and Papike (1973) find An<sub>96.5-97.1</sub>. Sad to say, the plagioclase in 60015 has been severely shocked. Some plagioclase needles are quench products of plagioclase glass. Maskelynite is not reported (?)

*Ilmenite:* Trace ilmenite is found within pyroxene aggregates.

**Metallic iron:** Hewins and Goldstein (1975) found the metallic iron was low in Ni and Co in the anorthosite, but high in the metal in the glass. Mao and Bell (1976) show that the metal composition is the result of reaction.

**High Pressure Phases:** HPP may be present and should be looked for!

#### **Chemistry**

A lot of chemical and isotopic analyses have been published for 60015 (Tables 1 and 2). Dixon and Papike (1973), Sclar and Bauer (1974) and See et al. (1986) have also provided microprobe analyses of the glass splash. Sclar and Bauer note that the glass has the same composition as Apollo 16 soil.

Laul and Schmitt (1973), Taylor et al. (1973) and others found anorthosite 60015 was lacking in trace elements (figure 9). Ebihara et al. (1992) determined the meteoritic siderophiles, showing that anorthosite 60015 had little meteoritic contamination.

#### Radiogenic age dating

Schaeffer and Husain (1974) determined a relatively nice Ar/Ar plateau at  $\sim$  3.5 b.y. (figure 11), which was

duplicated nicely by the work of Phinney et al. (1975) >3.49 b.y. (figure 12). However, this rock should be older than that !

Nunes et al. (1973, 1974) were not able to date 60015 by U, Th, Pb analysis due to severe Pb contamination (and very low U).

Nyquist et al. (1975) and Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1976) reported the Sr isotopic composition of 60015.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Schaeffer and Husain (1974) and Phinney et al. (1975) reported 38Ar exposure ages of 5.4 ± 0.7 m.y. and 3 ± 1 m.y. respectively. Leich and Niemeyer (1975) determined an accurate 81Kr exposure age of 1.9 ± 0.1 m.y. (~ the age of South Ray Crater). Niemeyer and Leich (1976) found they could release additionally rare gases by crushing the sample. Horz et al. (1975) reported an Ar exposure age of 1.8 m.y. and a "subdecimeter"age from track studies of 10 m.y.

This is a popular public display sample because of the black glass and white interior (figure 20). The sample was cut three different times. In 1972 the E1 end was sawn off (figure 4) and two slabs were made and thin column was cut from slab B (figures 17, 18). In 1975 the end piece was divided to create pieces for public displays. Again, in 1981, additional displays were cut from a piece sawn off of the west end (figures 15 and 16).

Saw marks are prominent in the photos (figure 2, 17, 18 and 19) indicating that the blade was dull (1972). Nunes et al. (1973) noted that sawing caused substantial Pb "contamination". Compare with the 1981 cut (figure 16).

Most of the thin sections are from the same portion of the sample.
