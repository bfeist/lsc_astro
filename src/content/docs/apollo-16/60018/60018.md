LMP What are you supposed to be doing while I do the double core?

CDR I'm supposed to be sampling.

CC Right. Be looking around for exotics - - especially things like that vesicular basalt you described.

LMP That's why I'm whacking on this one. That is a hard rock, right there, John.

LMP I've got it with the rake. Why don't you take that and put it in my sack and I'll go over and get the double core.

CDR Why don't you carry this one over there and throw it in my big bag.

LMP Okay, I'll do it. Okay, Tony, I just wacked off one at – I thought was basaltic looking but it turns out it's glassy with the white matrix in it (sic).

### **Introduction**

60018 was broken off of a corner of a 40 cm boulder perched on the surface at station 10 near the LM (figure 1). Since it was well photographed, and has zap pits on only one side, it is a well oriented sample. Although a slab was cut to be parallel to the Nadir, the rock was relatively inhomogeneous and apparently not used for cosmic-ray-penetration studies. However, it was determined to have a cosmic ray exposure age of 2.1 m.y. (the apparent age of South Ray Crater).

The top surface was covered with a mm thick glass coating which has many micrometeorite craters (figures 2, 7, 8). The freshly broken surface and the saw cut shows the boulder was a hodgepodge of white clasts set in a black glass matrix (figures 6, 9). The potential exists to discern the rock types present at South Ray Crater, by a careful study of the clasts in this rock.

*Note: As is the case for other lunar samples, the orientation of the cube in the lab photos has nothing to do with lunar orientation. In this case, T1 is approximately pointed down. The B1 and S1 faces have the glass coating and zap pits, indicating exterior of boulder.* 

### **Petrography**

Ryder and Norman (1980) give the only petrographic description of 60018. They make mention of basaltic texture, but this may be incorrect. Thin sections show that the plagioclase is highly shocked (figure 3). It seems clear that in order to study 60018, it needs to be better dissected (probably in air), and the various lithologies kept separate. On the other hand the sample

may be too shocked and shock melted to be of much use.

The glass coating on this boulder is apparently glass from South Ray Crater (See et al. 1986).

### **Chemistry**

Taylor et al. (1973) and Ebihara et al. (1992) reported the chemical composition of 60018, but since it is non homogeneous, one does not know what to make of this. Ryder and Norman (1980) refer to unpublished analyses by Haskin.

Moore et al. (1973) reported only 32 ppm carbon. Moore and Lewis (1976) found only 18 ppm nitrogen.

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Nunes et al. (1974, 1977) and Eugster and Niedermann (1986) reported ages, but again, what are the ages of?

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

The cosmic ray exposure age of 60018 was determined to be 2.1 ± 0.5 my. by 38Ar, 83Kr and 81Kr methods (Eugster and Niedermann 1986).

### **Other Studies**

Eugster and Niedermann (1986) reported rare gas abundance and isotopic ratios.

Sugirua et al. (1978) studied the heating effects on the magnetization of 60018.

### **Processing**

60018 was returned loose in SCB#7 along with other large rocks, documented bags and core tubes. There were ~ 460 grams of fines in bottom of bag, some probably derived from 60018.

There are 14 thin sections of 60018.
