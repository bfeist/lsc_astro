## **Introduction**

64818 is a rake sample collected from the rim of a small crater at station 4 on Stone Mountain – see section on 64801.

## **Petrography**

Phinney et al. (1976) refer to 64818 as a "tough crystalline breccia" with 5% vugs and vesicles, while Warner et al. (1973) called in a "meta-norite". Ryder and Norman (1980) called it a "dilithologic breccia" (?) so I will just call it a breccia, until a proper petrologic description shows up.

A single 3 mm clast of "cataclastic anorhosite" is reported by Ryder and Norman (1980). There is also a glassy portion!

## **Chemistry**

None

## **Radiogenic age dating**

None

## **Processing**

There are two thin sections.
