## **Introduction**

67615 is a rake sample from inside the rim of North Ray Crater (NRC) – see section on 67601. It is unusual in that it has olivine as the main mafic mineral and it may have a high proportion of opaque phases (figure 3). It is rounded and has zap pits on all sides (figure 1).

## **Petrography**

67615 has abundant clasts of plagioclase with a matrix that is described as micropoikilitic by Steele and Smith (1973) and basaltic by Ryder and Norman (1980)(figure 3). Steele and Smith (1973) determined that the plagioclase was An and olivine Fo 67615 92-97 52-64. apparently lacks pyroxene (figure 4).

## **Chemistry**

Stoffler et al. (1985) reported analyses (table) and found it grouped with "granulitic" breccias (figure 6).

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Stoffler et al. (1985) reported Ar/Ar data for 67615 (figure 5).

## **Processing**

There is only one small thin section and more could be learned if there was another.
