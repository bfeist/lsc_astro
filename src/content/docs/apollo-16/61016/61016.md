# **Introduction**

Lunar sample 61016 is the largest sample returned by the Apollo missions. It is know as "Big Muley"; named after Bill Muehlberger, the leader of the Apollo 16 field geology team. It was found perched on the east rim of Plum Crater and its lunar orientation is roughly known from television photos and zap-pitted top surface (Sutton 1981).

The Apollo 16 site was chosen to be in the lunar highlands, so that material could be collected that was distinctly different from that which was sampled in the Maria (A11, A12, A15). The pre-mission mapping, and consensus opinion, was that the rocks from the Descartes site would be volcanic (Milton 1968; Hodges 1972). However, the majority of the material returned from Apollo 16 turned out to be breccia with high plagioclase content. Chemists initially thought that the melt rock samples from Apollo 16 were "high alumina basalt", but when these samples were found to have high siderophile content, the evidence for impact origin was clear (Hubbard et al. 1973; Dowty et al. 1973; James 1981). Post mission analysis has pointed to an origin of a large portion of the Apollo 16 material as basin ejecta from Nectaris (Turner 1977; Maurer et al. 1978; James 1981 and others).

61016 has a cosmic ray exposure age (1.8 m.y.) that links it to the ejecta from South Ray Crater (Eugster 1999). The top side of 61016 is rounded, with thin patina and numerous micrometeorite "zap" pits (figure 1). Solar-cosmic-ray-produced 21Ne profiles verify the top surface was exposed to the Sun (Rao et al. 1993). Surface photography (television shot) of 61016 was matched in the laboratory by Sutton (1981) (figure 2). The sample was found partially buried – see soil line drawn on photos in Sutton (1981).

What was known about this rock in 1980 was discussed in great detail in the catalog by Ryder and Norman (1980). The rock has been highly shocked, as evidenced by most of the plagioclase being converted to maskelynite and/or plagioclase glass. Since 1980, the rock has been dated at about  $3.97 \pm 0.25$  b.y. and used for determination of solar-cosmic-ray profile studies (see below). However, the petrology of the sample mostly remains undetermined.

#### **Petrography**

James (1981) has grouped 61016 with Apollo 16 samples termed "dimict" breccias, although the nature of 61016 is seemingly somewhat different (i.e. a piece of shocked anorthosite attached to a piece of troctolitic "melt rock"). Perhaps the best description of 61016 was provided by Stöffler et al. (1975), but this, the largest moon rock, seems to deserve further description in light of what is now known about lunar samples.

The majority of 61016 (figure 5) is apparently an impact "melt rock" with high Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (~25 wt %) and high KREEP content (figure 11). McGee et al. (1979) described the main lithology as "characterized by subangular to rounded clasts of partially to completely maskelynized plagioclase (up to 2 mm across) together with glassy and partially devirified lithig clast

contained in a subophitic matrix of tabular (0.1 to 0.2 mm) and lath-shapped (2 x 0.5 mm) maskelynite intregrown with subhedral to euhedral (0.1 mm) olivine crystals. A dark-brown glassy mesostasis fills intersticies." Because of its high modal olivine, Stöffler et al. (1975) termed this lithology as a "troctolitic matrix" and noted that all the plagioclase is diaplectic. (However, a high modal olivine content as reported by Stöffler is not consistent with the high  $Al_2O_3$  content). This "melt rock" lithology is apparently unusual and is lacking pyroxene. The relict olivine is apparently mafic ( $\sim$ Fo<sub>90</sub>), while the relict plagioclase is calcic ( $\sim$ An<sub>90</sub>).

The shocked/melted anorthosite that sits as a "cap" on 61016 is described by Steele and Smith (1973), Smith and Steele (1974), Dixon and Papike (1975) and Drake (1974) and is one of the largest pieces of anorthosite returned. Pyroxene analyses from the anorthosite (figure 10) show that it is typical of ferroan anorthosite. The boundary between the melt rock lithology and this anorthosite is made of melted plagioclase (figure 30).

The bottom surface of 61016 is covered by glass (figure 4) where it was protected from meteorite bombardment. This glass coating may have originally covered the rest of the sample as though the rock was once a "bomb".

See et al. (1986) and Stöffler et al. (1975) studied portions of the glass coating on 61016. There is reason to believe that 61016 was ejected from South Ray Crater.

# **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Stöffler et al. (1975) found the olivine in the melt rock portion was Fo82-93.

*Pyroxene:* No pyroxene is reported from the melt rock portion, but pyroxene grains in the anorthosite portion are found to be Fe-rich (figure 10).

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase in the melt rock portion is An Hansen et al. (1979) have studied the trace 92-98. elements in plagioclase in the anorthosite. Almost all plagioclase in this sample has been converted to maskelynite or plagioclase glass.

*Metal:* Misra and Taylor (1975) and Stöffler et al. (1975) found that metal grains in 61016 fell within the range of meteorite metal (Ni 4-8%; Co 0.3-0.5%).

# **Chemistry**

On the basis of chemical composition, Hubbard et al. (1973) grouped the dark "melt rock" portion of 61016 with rocks they termed VHA basalts (VHA stands for very high alumina). The melt rock portion has high REE content (table 1, figure 11). Note that the meteoritic siderophiles in this portion are high. Ganapathy et al. (1974) place this melt rock in their meteorite Group 1. Stöffler et al. (1975) made chemical

analyses of various portions of 61016 by broad beam electron microprobe technique and compared them with the experimental phase diagram of Walker et al. (1973). These analysis fall well off of the coetectic lines on the phase diagram (figure 13) showing that the areas analyzed are partially fused rock clasts and/or mixtures produced by secondary impact processes.

*Figure 9: Photomicrograph of thin section from troctolitic "melt rock" portion of 61016,9 showing relict clastic texture ( section is 20 mm across).* 

The anorthositic portion has been analyzed by Hubbard et al. (1974), Nava et al. (1974), Phillpotts et al. (1974) and others (table 2, figure 11). Meteoritic siderophiles in the anorthositic portion are low (Krahenbuhl et al. 1973) and it appears pristine (see figures 33, 34).

Stöffler et al. (1975), See et al. (1986) and Morris et al. (1986) determined the chemical composition of the glass coating (table 3, figure 12).

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Stettler et al. (1973) reported an age of ~3.65 b.y., but this age is less than certain because they did not obtain a good Ar/Ar plateau (figure 14). Huneke et al. (1977) made several experiments to determine the age of the anorthosite (figure 15). Recently, Eugster et al. (1999) have dated the melt rock portion at 3.97 ± 0.25 b.y., seemingly consistent with the age of Nectaris ( ~3.95 b.y.) as determined by other rocks (see table).

Nyquist et al. (1973, 1979) determined Rb, Sr and 87Sr/ 86Sr for both main lithologies of 61016. The 87Sr/86Sr for the anorthosite was found to be very low (0.699).

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Stettler et al. (1973) determined an exposure age of <7 m.y. by 38Ar. Using sample ,287, Rao et al. (1979), Venkatesan et al. (1980), Nautiyal et al. (1981) and Rao et al. (1993) determined a cosmic ray exposure age of 1.7 ± 0.2 m.y. for an assumed erosion rate of 5 mm/m.y. Averaging the results from all techniques, Eugster (1999) determined an average cosmic ray exposure age of 1.84 ± 0.4 m.y. for 61016. This is consistent with ejecta from South Ray Crater.

Wrigley (1973) determined 26Al = 104 dpm/kg and 22Na = 36 dpm/kg on a 132 gram piece of anorthosite (,173). Eldridge et al. (1973) found 26Al = 65 dpm/kg and 22Na = 30 dpm/kg for 61016,120 (bottom piece of ,8, shielded by rock and soil). Bhandari et al. (1975, 1976) determined 26Al depth profile.

Fleischer and Hart (1974) calculated cosmic-ray particle track ages of 20-40 m.y., whereas Bhattacharya and Bhandari (1975) obtained 1.7 m.y. using the same technique.

Rao et al. (1993) used the outer surface of 61016 to determine fine-scale, depth profiles for 21Ne, 22Ne and 38Ar isotopes produced, in situ, from nuclear interactions of energetic solar flare protons (figure 17).

The density and size distribution of micrometeorite craters was studied by Mandeville et al. (1976) and Bhandari et al. (1975).

# **Processing**

In 1972 large thick slab (2 cm) was cut from the middle of 61016 (figures 4, 18-23). The east end piece (,8) and the slab have been entirely subdivided (figures 5,6). The large end piece (,7) remained unstudied until about 1990-94, when pieces of the anorthosite cap were removed (figures 23-25) for solar-cosmic-ray studies.

Subsamples ,385 and ,468 have been carefully sectioned to provide depth profiles of solar-flarecosmic-ray radionuclide production (figures 16, 34).
