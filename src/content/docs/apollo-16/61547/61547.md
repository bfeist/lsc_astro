## **Introduction**

61547 and 61548 are chunks of devitrified glass that were collected by raking the regolith near large craters – see section on 61501. Thin sections show that they contain small clasts of plagioclase and feldspathic impact melt breccia.

Actually, there were a fair number of similar glass fragments at this location.
