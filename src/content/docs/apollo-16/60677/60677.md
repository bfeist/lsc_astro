## **Introduction**

60677 was collected as a rake sample near the LM (see section on 60600). Figure 1 shows that it is made of frothy black glass surrounding a chalky-white clast of anorthosite.

## **Petrography**

Ryder and Norman (1980), Dowty et al. (1974) and Warren et al. (1976) described the anorthosite as *"with granoblastic texture. Small, anhedral olivine grains reside in triple junctions formed by polygonal plagioclases. Pyroxene is absent. Ilmenite is accessory".*

However, the thin section shows it is a typical impact melt (figure 2).

## **Chemistry**

Warren et al. (1976) tabulated broad beam electron analyses (table).
