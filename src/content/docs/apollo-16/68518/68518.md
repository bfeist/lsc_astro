## **Introduction**

68518 is a rake sample collected from station 8 soil in an area thought of have disturbance from South Ray Crater – see section on 68501. It was described as a "cinder" by Smith and Steele (1972). Ryder and Norman (1980) noted that it may be a glass coated lithic fragment, but it has never been subdivided or studied. There is no thin section.
