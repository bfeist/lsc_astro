#### Introduction

61225 is a small chip of white material from the mysterious white soil collected from the trench at Plum Crater (see section on 61221). It has been dated at 3.9 b.y. by the Ar/Ar technique.

#### **Petrography**

Norman and Ryder (1980) give a very brief description of this particle. It was covered with chalky-white dust on most sides. However, it appeared igneous to them.

Marvin (1972) cataloged 4 – 10 mm coarse-fine particles from 61224 (and 61244) and Marvin and Mosie (1980) created a catalog of 1 - 4 mm coarsefines from 61222-23 (but not 61242-43). In this process they noted a number of white particles, some of which may be additional pieces of impact melt similar to 61225.

#### Chemistry

None

# Radiogenic age dating

Norman et al. (2006) obtained two dates for chips of 61225 (figure 2).
