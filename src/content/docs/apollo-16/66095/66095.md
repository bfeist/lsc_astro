*"One of the most striking features of the moon is its great depletions in volatiles, such as C, N, H2 O, Pb, Bi and Tl. Apparently these elements were left behind in the solar nebula when the moon accreted. For an understanding of the moon's chemistry, it would be of interest to know the magnitude of this depletion, relative to cosmic or terrestrial abundances. The only elements for which this can be estimated with some confidence are Tl and Pb ——."*

Lunar sample 66095 was collected from a boulder on X-ray determination (Taylor et al. 1973, 1974) showed the rim of a 10 meter crater at the base of Stone that some of it was the hydrous mineral phase akaganite Mountain (figure 1). During the original examination (FeOOH). Although this observation led to 66095 of 66095 by (M. Bass in Butler 1972), an unusual being labeled "Rusty Rock", the enrichment in 204Pb, amount of colored stain (figure 3) was reported on the Zn, Cl and other volatile elements in 66095 indicates surface and interior of 66095 (LSPET 1973). In thin that portions of this sample contain substantial section it was also noted that the iron grains within sublimates of unknown origin. Thus this sample has

otherwise portray and deserves renewed attention by chemists studying the transport of volatiles on the Moon!

The crystallization age of 66095 is 3.8 b.y. and cosmic ray exposure is 40-80 m.y. One side (B, S) of 66095 has abundant zap pits (figure 4). The sample is generally lacking in cavities.

It is possible that anhydrous metal salts (chlorides?) in 66095 combined with the moisture in the LM, CM, tropical Pacific and/or individual terrestrial laboratory, yielding terrestrial-like hydrogen and oxygen isotopic signatures (Friedman et al. 1974; Epstein and Taylor 1974). However, it is difficult to see how moisture penetrated into the sample to "rust" the interior metal grains.

# **Petrography**

Most of 66095 (~80%) is composed of a fine-grained, subophitic to ophitic impact melt-rock (figures 5, 6 and 7), which also contains a wide variety of lithic clasts (from basalt to anorthosite) (Garrison and Taylor 1980, Hunter and Taylor 1981). The suite of lithic clasts found in 66095 contains every highland rock type except norite. The matrix and many of the clasts have high meteoritic siderophiles (Ir, Au).

66095 contains a wide variety of fine-grained clasts of melt-rock ranging in texture from porphyritic to poikiloblastic to intergranular (Hunter and Taylor 1981). These appear to have a high REE content and all appear to be reworked (i.e. have high Ir, Au).

The types of plutonic clasts that are found in 66095 are best indicated by the plagioclase, mafic mineral composition diagram (figure 10). The intergranular and cataclastic anorthosites appear to be related to the Mg-gabbro trend, while the troctolitic anorthosites appear to be ferroan. A brief description of clasts analyzed is found as an appendix to Hunter and Taylor (1981).

Although numerous Apollo 16 rocks exhibit some rust around metallic iron grains, 66095 is unusual in that it has abundant evidence of alteration. Alteration is found in the interior as well as on the surface. In thin section, the thin grey margins to metallic iron grains indicates

rusting *insitu*. The brown stain extends into the silicates surrounding the iron grains. It is difficult to believe that this is the result of terrestrial alteration.

# **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Garrison and Taylor (1980) determined that olivine was uniform in composition (~Fo77) throughout the rock.

*Pyroxene:* Pyroxene compositions in various lithologies of 66095 are poorly documented. Garrison and Taylor (1980) state that pyroxene was variable W7 En72Fs20 to Wo17En65Fs18. Vaniman and Papike

(1980) also reported pyroxene compositions (figure 11), probably for the melt-rock matrix. Based on these preliminary results, 66095 seems to be a bit different compared with other lunar samples.

*Plagioclase:* Garrison and Taylor (1990) reported that the plagioclase was locally uniform but slightly variable

in different areas ( $An_{89-94}$ ). Bell and Mao (1973) report the minor element content of plagioclase.

**Spinel:** Rare grains of pink Cr-pleonaste spinel are found as mineral clasts in the matrix (Garrison and Taylor 1981).

*Metallic iron:* El Goresy et al. (1973) and Garrison and Taylor (1980) found that the Co and Ni in iron grains within clasts was slightly unusual, compared with that of iron in the matrix (figures 12 and 13). Misra and Taylor (1975) studied the Fe-Ni and schreibersite relationships.

**Sphalerite:** El Goresy et al. (1973) reported sphalerite rimming troilite in 66095 (table 8). Taylor et al. (1973) and El Goresy et al. (1973) reported that sphalerite contained ~28 % FeS.

**Cohenite:** El Goresy et al. (1973) show a picture of cohenite (Fe<sub>3</sub>C) needles in an iron grain in 66095 and give an analysis.

*Schreibersite:* Schreibersite was reported already in the original catalog (Butler 1972).

*Goethite:* Goethite was reported surrounding metal grains (Butler 1972, El Goresy et al. 1973, Taylor et al. 1973) (figure 5). El Goresy et al. (1973) give several analyses – with variable Cl contents (table 7).

**Akaganite:** Taylor et al. (1974) determined that some of the "rust" in 66095 was the hydrous iron oxide akaganite (FeOOH). They found it contained 1-3 % Cl, which may be evidence that the origin of the rust was by oxidation and hydration of FeCl<sub>2</sub> (lawrencite?).

**Salts:** El Goresy et al. (1973) recognized that the volatile metals were probably "salts" because Reed et al. had found that the chlorine was mostly leachable in hot water. They even promised to identify "the proper nature of these compounds" in a later report (didn't happen).

# **Chemistry**

Garrison and Taylor (1980) noted that *"the concept of whole-rock chemistry is meaningless"* in the case of a multi-component breccia like 66095. Nevertheless, what is known about the composition of 66095 is tabulated herein and the rare-earth-elements are plotted as usual (figure 10a, b). Note that the general similarity to dimict Apollo 16 breccias.

Ebihara et al. (1992) and Wanke et al. (1981) both analyzed portions of the same clasts, but generally got different results for the elements that can be compared, presumably because of sample inhomogeneity for such small splits.

*Volatiles:* Nunes and Tatsumoto (1973) found that "66095 contained a remarkably high amount of Pb, 85% of which is not supported by U or Th". Krahenbuhl et al. (1973) found that 66095 was "strikingly enriched in volatile elements such as Br, Cd, Ge, Sb, Tl and Zn". This was confirmed by Ebihara et al. (1981, 1992) who found that In is also included in this list (Tables 4 and 6). Allen et al. (1974) found high amounts of 204Pb, as well as high Tl, Zn, and Bi, in 66095. Hinthorne and Anderson (1974) determined

the isotopic composition of Pb in Cl-rich regions with the ion miocroprobe. Jovanovic and Reed (1976) found that Ru and Os were the "highest ever" in 66095. Jovanovic and Reed (1981) determined very high contents of Cl, Br and I in clasts and matrix of 66095. Everything points to a fumarolic source for the volatile elements in 66095, as was first discovered and articulated by Krahenbuhl et al. (1973).

Epstein and Taylor (1974) and Friedman et al. (1974) carefully studied the temperature release and isotopic composition of H<sub>2</sub>O released from 66095. Samples of 66095 were found to have far more H<sub>2</sub>O than any other rock sample and somewhat more H<sub>2</sub>O than any lunar soil. However, isotopic analysis indicated that the ä <sup>2</sup>H and ä <sup>18</sup>O were similar to that of terrestrial water.

Cirlin and Housley (1980) used thermal release curves to show that the volatiles (Pb, Zn and Cd) were present on the surfaces of grains from 66095 (figures 16 and 17). In an interesting set of experiments, Jovanovic and Reed (1981) showed that the Cl and Br were easily leached from clasts, matrix and whole rock samples of 66095 (Table 5). Wanke et al. (1981) showed that Zn and Cl were closely correlated (figure 18).

#### Radiogenic age dating

Turner et al. (1973) measured the Ar/Ar plateau age (figure 19). Nunes and Tatsumoto (1973) determined the U-Th-Pb systematics and Pb/Pb age (figure 20). Nyquist et al. (1973) reported Rb-Sr data for whole rock.

# Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

Turner et al. (1973) determined an <sup>37</sup>Ar exposure of 40-80 m.y. (figure 19). Rancitelli et al. (1973) determined the cosmic-ray-induced-activity of <sup>22</sup>Na = 44 dpm/kg. and <sup>26</sup>Al = 107 dpm/kg. Fruchter et al. (1978) determined 26Al and 53Mn giving exposure age of 0.9 and 1.4 m.y. respectively. Bhandari et al. (1973) determined a solar flare track density indicating exposure age of 1 m.y.

#### **Other Studies**

Nagata et al. (1973), Pearce et al.(1973) and Brecher (1975) determined the magnetic properties. Weeks (1973) provide electromagnetic resonance spectra. Tsay and Live (1976) and Tsay and Baumann (1977) found evidence for trace Fe+3 by ESR.

Heymann and Hubner (1974) determined rare gas contents.

Kerridge et al. (1975), Gibson and Moore (1973), Friedman et al. (1974) and Des Marais (1978) studied the isotopic composition of sulfur and carbon.

#### **Processing**

66095 was returned in a bag, so it would have seen the oxygen in the LM and, briefly, water vapor in the South Pacific. 66095 originally broke in two large pieces (see crack in figure 2). A large piece (,14) was pulled apart by the Rusty Rock Consortium (Larry Taylor). A piece (,60) was sawn into smaller pieces (figure 21).

There is an excellent description of 66095 in the original Apollo 16 catalog (by M. Bass in Butler 1972)

and research reported before about 1980 is discussed by Ryder and Norman (1980). Garrison and Taylor (1979) prepared a "guidebook" for "Rusty Rock", but apparently didn't get to examine the surface of 66095,1 (end piece in remote storage). Hunter and Taylor (1981) report preliminary results of the Rusty Rock Consortium (VAPOR) and the appendix therin, describes the sample splits sent to consortium members. Ebihara et al. (1992) compare data with that of Wanke et al. (1981) for subsamples of 66095 allocated to both groups.
