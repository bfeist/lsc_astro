### **Introduction**

63355 was collected from the chips off of Shadow Rock (see also 60017 and 63335). It is in several pieces and since they were picked from the soil, they may not all be from the boulder (see transcript in 60017). In any case, the chemical composition of 63355 is different from the other samples of Shadow Rock. Pieces of 63355 have patina and micrometeorite craters (figure 2).

## **Petrography**

Nord et al. (1975) report that 63355,7 is a dark matrix breccia with a clast population of angular noritic and anorthositic fragments. Nord et al. (1975) found that plagioclase in 63355 was shocked with many deformation features from an HV electron microscope petrographic study. They found that the matrix contains glass and there is no evidence of flow, as there is in 60017.

Ryder and Norman (1980) found that thin section 63355,48 is a poikilitic impact melt containing clasts and schieren of cataclastic plagioclase. The matrix has small orthopyroxene oikiocrysts with irregularly shaped plagioclase inclusions. There is ilmenite and glass between the oikiocrysts (see figure 4b, just for fun).

Misra and Taylor (1975) studied the metal particles (figure 6). Hunter and Taylor (1981) reported rust (which was not the case for 60017 nor 63335).

#### **Chemistry**

63355 has high Fe and Mg, and only moderate Al (table). The trace element content is also high, and not like that of the other samples of this boulder (table, figure 5). Ni, Ir and Au are very high.

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

none

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Clark and Keith (1973) determined the abundance of natural and cosmic ray induced radionuclides in Apollo 16 lunar samples. They reported 26Al = 98 dpm/kg, 22Na = 48 dpm/kg and 54Mn = 25 dpm/kg for 63355,1.

#### **Processing**

63355 was collected as several pieces (figure 2). There are three thin sections.
