### **Introduction**

Sample 68815 was chipped off the top of a large (1 m) boulder (figure 2) and has a well known lunar orientation. The outer surface is covered with zap pits (figure 1) and the broken surface contains large vugs and vesicles (figure 3). 68815 is one of the samples that date the age of South Ray Crater (Drozd et al. 1974; Pepin et al. 1974) and is said to have had a simple exposure history.

68815 has been extensively studied as a "beam stop" for solar radiation and has been proposed as a "reference standard" for cosmic ray studies (Behrmann et al. 1973).

## **Petrography**

68815 contains a variety of small (~1 mm) anorthositic clasts welded in a heterogeneous, glassy matrix (Brown et al. 1973). The brown to yellow basaltic glasses are banded on a fine scale in complex swirl and lobate patterns. The unmelted fragments include gabroic, noritic and troctolitic variants, but all are rich in plagioclase. No clasts equivalent of mare basalt are found.

Dixon and Papike (1978) describe two prominent lithic clasts in 68815 (figure 3). Clast I is composed of approximately 40% olivine and orthopyroxene, 60% plagioclase and small amounts of ilmenite, chrome spinel and Fe metal. Small, anhedral opx and olivine grains are dispersed throughout a feldspar matrix which is optically continuous over tens of millimeters. Clast II is 30% mafic, 70% plagioclase and has a

#### Transcript:

LMP It doesn't have any dust on top of it.

CC We don't need dust from the top.

CDR OK, but I thought you didn't want breccia. OK, let's get the chip.

LMP That's a hard breccia, ain't it?

CDR A hard, hard rock.

LMP Hit it right here on this corner in your shadow now. Down a little bit. There you go.

CC Hey, Charlie, you just dropped a sample.

LMP Want to crack it in two or bring the whole – it's not gonna be any good unless we can get it in the sack.

### **Mineralogy**

*Pyroxene:* Dixon and Papike (1978) reported pyroxene compositions of lithic clasts in 68815 (figure 4).

*Olivine:* Olivine composition ranges Fo69-73.

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase ranges An96-90.

*Glass:* Glass compositions are reported in Dixon and Papike (1978) (Al2 O3 = 20-35%).

Metal grains were analyzed by Misra and Taylor (1975). Brown et al. (1973) give the analysis of shreibersite-iron intergrowth (with high Ni).

## **Chemistry**

68815 is heterogeneous by its nature (figure 3). Major elements were determined as part of the preliminary examination (LSPET 1973), by "classical methods" (Scoon 1974) and by Wänke et al. (1974)(table 1). Kohl et al. (1978) determined Fe, Al and Mn by atomic absorption in 14 different sub-samples and found rather consistent results (FeO = 3.14 – 5.5; Al2 O3 = 26.5 –

30.5). Trace elements were determined by Krähenbühl et al. (1973), Wänke et al. (1974) and Fruchter et al. (1974) (figure 5).

Chemical data for the two prominent white clasts (figure 2) appear to be lacking.

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Schaeffer et al. (1976) and Schaeffer and Schaeffer (1977) reported 39Ar/40Ar plateau and K/Ar ages for glass and several clasts within 68815 (figures 8 - 9).

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Behrmann et al. (1973) and Drozd et al. (1974) determined the cosmic ray exposure age of 68815 (2.04 ± 0.08 m.y.) by the 81Kr-Kr method and associated this age with the South Ray Crater event.

This rock provided an ideal substrate to study the interaction of solar cosmic rays. Clark and Kieth (1973) determined the activity of 22Na (56 ± 11 dpm/kg), 26Al

(150 ± 30 dpm/kg), 53Mn (21 ± 6 dpm/kg), 56Co and 46Sc for a bulk sample (34.5 g) of 68815. Fruchter et al. (1977, 1978) determined 26Al (63 ± 2.4 dpm/kg) and 53Mn (71 ± 6 dpm/kg). Kohl et al. (1978) determined the depth profiles for 53Mn (265 to 83 dpm/kg)(figure 10) and 26Al (337 to 96 dpm/kg)(figure 11). Jull et al. (1998) determined the 14C depth profile (figure 12). Rao et al. (1994) determined depth profiles for 3 He, 21Ne and 38Ar (figure 13). Nishiizumi et al. (1988) determined 10Be and found that it did not vary as a function of depth.

The depth profile studies of 14C by Jull et al. (1998) showed that the radiation hardness (rigidity R0 ) and flux of solar protons was higher than that determined by 10Be, 26Al and 53Mn measurements.

Jull et al. (1995) detected a small amount of solarimplanted 14C in etched samples of patina scrapped from the surface of 68815, although less than predicted by Fireman et al. (1977).

#### **Other Studies**

Sample 68815 was proposed initially as a "reference standard" for cosmic ray track and micrometeorite density studies (Behrmann et al. 1973), because of its simple exposure history. Behrmann et al. (1973) counted between 30 and 50 pits > 30 micron in size on a ½ cm² surface area, which is about 4 times higher than what was predicted by Morrison et al (1973). Walker and Yuhas (1973) and Dust and Crozaz (1977) determined nuclear track density as a function of depth (figure 13). The density of tracks is found to be consistent with the 2 m.y. exposure history and erosion rate of 1-2 mm per m.y. Dust and Crozaz go on to claim that "the agreement of this spectrum with that measured for contemporary cosmic rays demonstrates the long term-constancy of the galactic cosmic ray flux of very heavy ions" (one wonders).

Leich et al. (1973, 1974), Padawer et al. (1974) and Stauber et al. (1973) studied the H and F content of the surface of 68815 and Goldberg et al. (1976) studied vesicle walls.

Nagata et al. (1973), Cisowski et al, (1974) and Schwrer and Nagata (1976) studied magnetic properties of 68815. Schwerer et al. (1973), Huffman et al. (1974) and Huffman and Dunmyre (1975) reported Mossbauer spectra.

### **Processing**

In 1972, 68815 broke into two pieces (labeled ,19 and ,20 see sketch, figure 14) and sub-sample ,19 was sawn into ,32 and ,31. Sub-sample , 32 was sawn into slabs A and C. In 1974, sub-sample ,31 was divided by sawing to obtain a thick (1 in) column (top ,192; bottom ,191)(figure 15). In 1975, the remainder of ,31 was sawn on an oblique angle to obtain a top piece (,234; figure 16), and in half to produce ,238 and ,31 (now smaller). In 1992-3, ,238 was sawn again to obtain a slab and a column ,292 (as perpendicular to the lunar surface as could be obtained)(sketches figures 17-18).
