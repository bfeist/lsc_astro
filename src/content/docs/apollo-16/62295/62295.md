It was collected near impact-melt breccia characterized by randomly Buster Crater and is 3.87 b.y. old, with cosmic ray oriented plagioclase laths (up to 0.8 mm) intergrown exposure 300 m.y. with skeletal olivine crystals resulting in a variolitic texture (figure 2).

complex mesostasis and relict clasts of plagioclase, rare lithic clasts and conspicuous barred olivine-like bodies scattered randomly throughout the rock. Octahedra of tiny pink Mg-rich spinel commonly occur in plagioclase. Both irregular vugs (up to 1 mm) and spherical vesicles (up to 0.4 mm) are relatively common.

Brown et al. (1973) and Norman and Ryder (1980) describe 62295 as a fine-grained, mesostasis-rich basaltic impact melt with the mineralogy of a "spinel troctolite". Xenocrysts of Mg-rich olivine, Ca-rich plagioclase, pink spinel and metal grains (with attached schreibersite) are found throughout (figure 4).

Walker et al. (1973) found reaction rims on some inclusions along with evidence of extremely rapid crystallization. Weiblen and Roedder (1973) studied melt inclusions in the olivine and plagioclase.

#### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Olivine is present as xenocrysts ( $Fo_{90.95}$ ) and as fine skeletal grains ( $Fo_{75.92}$ ) in the matrix (spiniflex texture). Steele and Smith (1975) reported on the minor elements in olivine.

**Pyroxene:** Clinopyroxene with ferroaugite composition is a minor phase found only in the mesostasis (figure 3).

**Plagioclase:** McGee et al. (1979), Hodges and Kushiro (1973), Walker et al. (1973) and Vaniman and Papike (1981) determined plagioclase was An<sub>95,91</sub>.

**Spinel:** Pink Mg, Al- spinel is 9-16% chromite.

*Metal:* Misra and Taylor (1975) and Taylor et al. (1976) studied metal particles in 62295 (figure 5).

*Schreibersite:* Hunter and Taylor (1981) reported abundant schreibersite. Schreibersite in 62295 is Ni rich (Brown et al. 1973).

# **Chemistry**

The bulk analysis of 62295 by Eldridge et al. (1973) is consistent with the small samples analyzed by Rose et al. (1973), Wanke et al. (1976) and Hubbard et al. (1973). The sample is very Mg rich (table 1) and plots near the coetectic on the multisaturated equilibrium phase diagram (figure 8). It contains substantial Ni and Ir, indicating meteoritical contamination of the melt. The rare earth element content is high (figure 7).

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Nyquist et al. (1973) determined the Sr isotopic composition. Turner et al. (1973) determined the age (3.89 b.y.) of 62295 by the Ar/Ar plateau technique

(figure 9). Mark et al. (1974) determined a Rb/Sr isochron of 4.0 b.y. (figure 10). Norman et al. (2006) repeated these measurements with perhaps better instrumentation and got essentially the same result (3.866 ± 0.012 b.y.)(figures 11 and 12).

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Eldridge et al. (1973) determined the cosmic-rayinduced activity of 26Al = 110 dpm/kg and 22Na = 59 dpm/kg. Turner et al. (1973) determined an exposure age of 310 m.y. by 38Ar. Marti et al. (1974) determined a 81Kr exposure age of 235 m.y. Bhandari et al. (1973) reported on the solar flare tracks in 62295.

# **Other Studies**

Taylor and Epstein (1973) reported the oxygen isotope composition of 62295 and Lightner and Marti (1974) reported Xe isotopes.

Walker et al. (1973), Hodges and Kushiro (1973) and Ford et al. (1974) experimentally studied phase equilibria as function of temperature and pressure (figure 14), but these experiments seem meaningless if the rock is an impact melt.

Morrison et al. (1973) and Neukum et al. (1973) studied the microcraters on the exposed surface of 62295 (figure 16).

Brecher et al. (1973) studied the magnetic properties and Todd et al. (1973), Wang et al. (1973) and Katsube and Collett (1973) studied the physical properties of 62295.

# **Processing**

The rock broke in three pieces along existing cracks (figure 13). One piece (,5), was sawn apart (figures 15 and 17). This is an "oriented sample", but it has not been studied as such. There are 33 thin sections of 62295. The research on 62295 is well summarized in the catalog by Ryder and Norman (1980).
