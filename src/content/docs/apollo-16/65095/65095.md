# **Introduction**

About half of this sample has a thick coat of black glass (figure 1). Most of the sample is a feldspathic regolith breccia (figure 2), but there is also a unique "chalky white chunk" neatly tucked between the regolith breccia and the black glass coat (figure 1). The main portion of 65095 has a friable white matrix with large grey breccia clasts.

# **Petrography**

McKay et al. (1986) reported that although this is a regolith breccia, it has very low maturity (Is/FeO = 0), very low solar wind rare gas and no agglutinates. The matrix has a high proportion of clasts including grains of plagioclase, mafic minerals, metal, troilite, ilmenite, spinel as well as clasts of poikilitic and basaltic impact melt, cataclastic anorthosite and rare

mafic vitrophyres. There are also fragments of glass in the matrix indicating that the sample may be a regolith breccia.

Ryder and Norman (1980) and Butler (1972) describe thin sections ,13 ,14 ,15 as a "crushed anorthosite".

# **Significant Clast**

#### *Chalky White Chunk: ,20 TS,49 TS,13*

Figure 1 shows a relatively large chunk of white material (~15 g) that is distinctly separated from the rest of the sample. Bickel and Warner (1978) reported that thin section ,49 contained a coarsegrained ferroan anothosite (figure 4). The chalky appearance may mean that this fragment has been highly shocked.

# **Mineralogy**

*Metal:* Misra and Taylor (1975) reported the Ni and Co content of iron grains (figure 5).

*Rust:* Hunter and Taylor (1981) report minor rust around metal grains.

*Glass:* Wentworth and McKay (1988), and Shearer et al. (1990) describe and analyze mafic glass beads with "komatiitic" composition. The outer black glass coating was analyzed by See et al. (1986).

# **Chemistry**

McKay et al. (1986), Korotev (1996), Morris et al. (1986), Krahenbuhl et al. (1973) and Eldridge et al. (1973) reported the chemical composition of the 65095 (table 1). All splits have high Ni, Ir and Au indicating meteoritic contamination. However, the "chalky white chunk" has apparently not been analyzed (Korotev?).

# **Radiogenic age dating**

There are no age data for 66095

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

The cosmic ray induced activity of 65095 is "saturated" with 26Al = 104 dpm/kg and 22Na = 28 dpm/kg (Eldridge et al. 1973).

# **Other Studies**

The 40Ar/36Ar ratio of this sample is extremely high (480), normally found in ancient regolith breccias (McKay et al. 1986)

The magnetic properties of 65095 were studied by Sigiura et al. (1978) and others (figure 6).

# **Processing**

First the "chalky white chuck" was removed and three thin sections of it were made. Later the bulk sample broke along a penetrating fracture into two large pieces and several smaller ones. There are 16 thin section. The sample has not been sawn.
