# **Introduction**

These chalky white rocks were returned in the same bag. They are from a rake sample taken near the White Boulder on the south rim of North Ray Crater - see section on 67481. They are friable, which is why they are rounded. They contain lithic fragments of cataclastic anorthosite and feldspathic granulite.

# **Petrography**

Steele and Smith (1972) gave the original descriptions of these particles. Ryder and Norman (1980) and Stoffler et al. (1981) found that they were feldspathic granulite and contain areas of aphanitic impact melt. In thin section they appear to be pristine and monomict (figures 7 - 13). They are mostly plagioclase, with only minor mafic minerals. Textures of lithic fragments vary from cataclastic anorthosite to feldspathic granulite.

Although there are eight thin sections, there has been no petrographic description with resulting pyroxene diagrams. They await study - perhaps along with the White Boulder samples (67455 etc.)
