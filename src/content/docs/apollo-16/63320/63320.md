# **Introduction**

Apollo 16 soil samples 63320 and 63340 were collected from a "recess" far under the shadow cast by Shadow Rock (figures 1 and 2). However, Ulrich (1981) calculates that sunlight could have reached this area during the movement of the Sun across the sky. 63320 was collected from the surface and 63340 from underneath 63320 (Sutton 1981). A "companion soil" 63501 was collected from the unshaded regolith, 15 m southeast of Shadow Rock.

Shadow Rock is located at the boundary of the Cayley Plains with the slope of Smoky mountain (figure 3). Shadow Rock is about 550 m south of the rim of North Ray Crater and the soils there are estimated to be about 50% young soil derived from North Ray Crater and 50% old soil (they have cosmic ray exposure ages of ~ 270 m.y.)

Eberhardt et al. (1976) found that 40Ar and various volatile elements (In, Tl, Zn, Cd, Br and I) are enriched by about the same amount (~30-40%) in 63321 and 63341 compared with 63501. It is suggested that the shadowed area acted as a cold trap for volatiles in the lunar atmosphere.

# **Petrography**

Horz et al. (1972) write *"a hole more than 1 m deep and approximately 50 cm wide was observed at the south end of Shadow Rock at station 13. Because of the shadowed condition, no precise surface photography is available, but the comments of the crew about the geometry of the "gopher hole" indicate that the soil materials were permanently shielded from the Sun. After the samples were received in the LRL, samples 63320 and 63340 were placed in specially sealed containers."* 

63320 and 63340 are submature soils with Is /FeO values of 47 and 54 respectively (Morris 1978). Companion soil 63501 has Is /FeO = 46. Average grain

size is 88 microns for 63321, 80 microns for 63341 and 70 microns for 63501. Heiken et al. (1973) and Houck (1982) determined the mineralogic mode of 63321 and 63341 and compared them with nearby reference soil 63501 (they look similar). Graf (1991) reported the grain size distribution and determined the average grain size to be larger, if you take into account the > 1mm particles (figure 8 a,b).

Marvin (1972) cataloged the 4 – 10 mm coarse fine particles from these soils. Breccia samples 60017, 63335 and 63355 were chipped from Shadow Rock (Butler 1972).

# **Chemistry**

The chemical compositions of the shadowed soils are given in tables 1 and 2 and figure 4 and 6. Eberhardt et al. (1976) compared the volatile element concentrations of 63321, 63341 and 63501 (figure 7).

Evensen et al. (1974) determined the composition of alkalis as a function of grain size. Jovanovic and Reed

(1973) determined halogens, Hg, Ru, Os and U for 63321, 63341 and 63501 finding nothing unusual about their concentrations. Wanke et al. (1975) also determined halogens for 63320, finding them low in concentration. Muller (1973) and Kothari and Goel (1973) found nitrogen (~60 ppm) to be similar in all three samples. DesMarias et al. (1973) determined the carbon content (66 ppm) and Gibson and Moore (1973) found about 500 ppm sulfur (no more than elsewhere). The carbon content is relatively high (saturated?) for a submature soil (figure 5).

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Eberhardt et al. (1976) determined the average cosmic ray exposure ages of 63321, 63241 and 63501 to be 260 m.y., 290 m.y. and 260 m.y. respectively using 78Kr, 124Xe and 126 Xe measurements. Fireman et al. (1973) determined the tritium content (3 H) of the shadowed soil 63321 (233 dpm/kg). Eldridge et al. (1976) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 22Na = 25 and 28 dpm/kg., 26Al = 69 and 91 dpm/kg. and 54Mn = 40 and 50 dpm/kg., for 63320 and 63340, respectively.

Imarura et al. (1974) determined the cosmic–rayinduced activity of 53Mn = 359 dpm/kg. The high 53Mn activity could be due to lateral transport of freshly irradiated material under the boulder, or Shadow Rock may have been emplaced in its present location a short time ago (the half-life of 53Mn is 3.7 m.y.).

# **Other Studies**

Kirsten et al. (1973) and Bogard and Nyquist (1973) reported the rare gas composition of shaded soils 63321 and 63341, but didn't find anything unusual with respect to other soils. However, Eberhardt et al. (1976) discovered an enrichment of 40Ar of 38% for 63321 and 28% for 63341 relative to 63501 (figure 6). They

#### **Processing**

Sad to say, these shadowed soils were not returned in a sealed container. They were only protected from humid spacecraft cabin air and Pacific atmosphere by the Teflon bags that they were collected in, surrounded by layers of porous beta cloth (Teflon-coated, woven, fiberglass). They would have experienced several cycles of depressurization – repressurization in the LM, one in the CM. They were sealed in Pacific air during transfer to the LRL. Finally they were exposed to the residual moisture of the "dry" N<sub>2</sub> glove boxes during preliminary examination.

However, only small portions of 63320 and 63340 were sieved and large portions have apparently been kept in the original Teflon collection bags (DB). In 1979, portions were split off to go into remote storage, again temporarily exposing the sample to "dry"  $N_2$  cabinet air in the new curation facility ( $N_2$  cabinet air has variously 10-50 ppm  $H_2O$ ).
