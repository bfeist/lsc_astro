LMP Look at this rock right here, John. Pure white. Yeah, it's really shocked whatever it is. It looks like chalk, Tony, it's so shocked. It's about pebble size and it's broken open, let's make it 5 cm long, broken open. Hey, John. Can I get a bag from you. I picked up that white -

CDR I'll get it for you.

LMP Thank you. That white shocked rock. It's broke in two. There's two pieces of it. Partially documented.

## **Introduction**

Lunar sample 67075 is very friable (figure 1). The original PET description (LSPET 1973) was that of a crushed anorthosite with evidence of some flow (figure 3) and some recrystallization in the solid state (120 deg. triple junctions, figure 4). Detailed petrographic description showed that the sample may be a mixture of closely related anorthositic rocks from a layered

igneous intrusion (McCallum et al. 1975). Chemical analyses show a range of  $Al_2O_3$  (31-34%) and FeO (1-4%) contents. Ryder and Norman (1980) reported that 67075 was about 95% plagioclase.

67075 was originally collected as two broken parts of a conspicuous white rock on the lunar surface near the rim of North Ray Crater (Sutton 1991). During transit to Earth it broke into numerous pieces, such that lunar orientation and zap pits on original surface can no longer be discerned. It has proven difficult to date, but it has been shown to be 4.47 b.y. old, with about 50 m.y. exposure to cosmic rays (see below).

#### **Petrography**

Pecket and Brown (1973), Brown et al. (1973) and McCallum et al. (1975) all suggest that 67075 was assembled from genetically-related fragments of a layered plutonic anorthosite complex. This explanation can explain the pyroxene exsolutions and the range of compositions of mafic minerals (Ryder and Norman 1980). Nord et al. (1975) showed that 67075 was "lithified" or cemented by a mild shock-heating event – such as the North Ray Crater impact.

In addition to calcic plagioclase, 67075 has minor olivine, low-Ca pyroxene, high-Ca pyroxene and traces of Cr-spinel, ilmenite, Fe-Ni metal, troilite and silica. Plagioclase occurs in grains up to 2 mm in size.

McCallum and O'Brien (1996) used low-Ca, high-Ca pairs to calculate cooling rates and the depth of burial of 67075 (14 km).

#### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Brown et al. (1973) and McCallum et al. (1975) reported Fe-rich olivine (Fo<sub>44-55</sub>). Smith and Steele (1975) determined trace elements in olivine.

**Pyroxene:** Steele and Smith (1973), Brown et al. (1973), Dixon and Papike (1975), McCallum et al. (1975) and others studied the exsolution of pyroxene fragments in 67075, including the inverted pigeonite (figures 5 and 6).

*Plagioclase:* Brown et al. (1973), Steele and Smith (1973), Dixon and Papike (1975) and McCallum et al. (1975) reported calcic plagioclase (An93-97) in 67075. Meyer et al. (1974), Meyer (1979), Hansen et al. (1979) and Steele et al. (1990) studied the trace element content of plagioclase (An97). Gose et al. (1975) studied cation ordering.

*Chromite:* El Goresy et al. (1973) reported two distinct occurrences of spinel: primary Ti-chromite and breakdown of ulvospinel. Okamura et al. (1976) studied spinel lamallae exsolved from augite.

## **Chemistry**

The chemical analyses of splits of 67075 show a slight variation in mafic mineral content but similar REE

content (Haskin et al. 1973, Hubbard et al. 1974, Scoon 1974, Wanke et al. 1975 and Lindstrom et al. 1981)(figure 8). The analysis by Hertogen et al. (1977) showed a very minor meteoritic siderophile content.

Moore et al. (1973) reported only 5 ppm carbon, while Jovanovic and Reed (1976) reported minor halogens.

## **Radiogenic age dating**

67075 was dated by the 39Ar/40Ar plateau technique as 4.04 ± 0.05 b.y. (figure 9)(Truner et al. 1973). Huneke et al. (1977) could not obtain a good plateau, but the plagioclase may be 3.95 b.y. (figure 10).

*Figure 11: U/Pb isochron diagram showing data for 67075 (from Premo et al. 1989).* 

Silver (1973abs) noted excess Pb in 67075 that was apparently "unsupported" by the U and Th. Oberli et al. (1979abs) obtained Pb isotope values closer to the isochron defined by the cataclysm. Lead isotopes in 67075 were again studied by Premo et al. (1989) who found that the data defined two intercepts with Concordia at 4.09 and 4.35 b.y. (figure 11).

Nyquist et al. (2010 and 11) found concordant Rb/Sr and Nd/Sm ages at 4.47 ± 0.07 b.y. (figure 12 a,b).

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Turner et al. (1973) reported a 38Ar exposure age of 46 m.y., Marti et al. (1973) reported the 81Kr exposure age of 48.5 ± 5.5 m.y. and Hohenberg et al. (1978) calculated 50.2 and 49 m.y. exposure ages.

## **Other Studies**

Lightner and Marti (1974) and Drozd et al. (1977) reported the isotopic composition of Xe.

Weeks et al. (1973) studied the paramagnetic resonance of Fe3+, Ti3+ and Mn2+ in plagioclase.

## **Processing**

67075 was returned in Teflon bag #384 is SCB7. There are 17 thin sections
