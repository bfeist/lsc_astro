## **Introduction**

60535 has numerous micrometeorite craters on one 60535 and 60637 are rake samples from the area near side. the LM. They are typical glass matrix regolith breccias.

**Processing Petrography** 60535 has 4 thin section and 60637 has 3. Warner et al. (1976) described 60535 and 60637 as "fragmental breccias", but they have all the attributes of compacted lunar soil. They appear similar. Glass shards, lithic fragments and mineral fragments in a seriate grain size distribution (figure 2).
