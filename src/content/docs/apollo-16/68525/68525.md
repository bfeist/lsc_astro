## **Introduction**

68525, 68526 and 68527 are rake samples collected from station 8 soil in an area thought of have disturbance from South Ray Crater – see section on 68501. They appear to be impact melt breccia, with poikilitic texture, but have not been studied.

Compositional variation of Apollo 16 impact-melt rocks is discussed by Korotev (1994).

## **Processing**

There is one thin section of 68525, two for 68526 and one for 68527. *Figure 2: Thin section of 68525 showing poikilitic*
