### **Introduction**

64816 is a rake sample collected from the rim of a small crater at station 4 on Stone Mountain – see section on 64801. It is a holocrystalline poikilitic impact melt with a crystallization age of 3.85 b.y.

## **Petrography**

Simonds et al. (1973) included 64816 in their report on poikilitic Apollo 16 samples (now known as impact melts). Pigeonite oikocrysts include olivine and plagioclase chadocrysts. Ilmenite is concentrated between pyoxene oikocrysts and patches of interstitial liquid found in interstial regions have subophitic texture (figure 2). Gooley et al. (1973) reported metallic nickel-iron grains. Hunter and Taylor (1981) verified that these were rust free.

*Pyroxene:* The composition of mafic minerals is slightly more Mg-rich than most Apollo 16 poikilitic impact melts (figure 3).

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase in 64816 has a wide range of composition (An80-98).

#### **Mineralogical Mode**

From Simonds et al. 1973 Plagioclase Pyroxene Olivine Opaque 59 % 34 4 2

### **Chemistry**

Not reported

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Norman et al. (2006) determined an age of 3.85 ± 0.01 b.y. for 64816 by the Ar/Ar plateau technique (figure 4).

### **Other Studies**

Pearce and Simonds (1974) studied the magnetic properties.

### **Processing**

There is only one thin section of 64816.
