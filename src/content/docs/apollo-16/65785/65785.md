# Introduction

This small rake sample contains a coarse-grained pink spinel troctolite clast in a crystalline feldspathic impact melt rock (figure 1). The impact melt has been dated at 3.97 b.y. by one group and 3.83 b.y. by another.

#### **Petrography**

Dowty et al. (1974b) describe the pink spinel troctolite clast (figure 2). It is modally 65% plagioclase ( $An_{98}$ ), 30% olivine ( $Fo_{85}$ ) and 5% Mg-Al spinel. The pink spinel occurs as one large crystal (1 mm). Irregular plagioclase grains (0.1 – 1 mm) are surrounded by one large olivine grain. Minor phases are pyroxene,

ilmenite, armalcolite, rutile, metal, troilite, whitlockite, farringtonite and K-feldspar (Warner et al. 1976).

Warner et al. (1976) describe the crystalline impactmelt rock that surrounds the clast. In it the plagioclase  $(An_{95})$  occurs predominantly as laths about 0.2 mm long ophitically within olivine  $(Fo_{79})$  and minor pyroxene grains. The fine-grained portion also has trace spinel, chromite, armalcolite, whitlockite, apatite, zirkelite and schreibersite as minor phases.

Keil et al. (1975) suggested that the melt-rock portion of 65785 may be a mixture of the troctolite lithology

with KREEP. Ryder and Norman (1980) summarize the results. Compositional variation of Apollo 16 impact-melt rocks is discussed by Korotev (1994).

# **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* The olivine occurs as a large grain surrounding and including the other phases in the thin section of the pink spinel troctolite clast. It is slightly more mafic (Fo85) than the olivine found in the surrounding matrix (Fo80).

*Farringtonite*: Dowty et al. (1974b) and Warner et al. (1976) reported a rare phosphate (Mg3 (PO4 )2 ) in the pink spinel troctolite clast.

*Pyroxene:* The pyroxene in 65785 is mafic in composition (figures 4 and 5).

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase is An95-98.

*Mg-Al Spinel:* The large pink spinel grain in 65785 is zoned in Cr content (2.6 to 12.6%), increasing outward from the center (Dowty et al. 1974b).

*Armalcolite:* Dowty et al. (1974) determined the composition of armalcolite grains and reported on unpublished Pb-Pb age dating by ion microprobe analysis.

*Metallic iron:* Dowty et al. (1974b) found Ni = 2 25%, Co = 0.5-1.5%

# **Chemistry**

The pink spinel troctolite composition was determined by broad beam electron probe analysis (Warner et al. 1976). Murali et al. (1977) reported the trace element analysis of the surrounding impact-melt (table 1, figure 6).

# Radiogenic age dating

Schaeffer and Schaeffer (1977) determined the Ar/Ar plateau age of the feldspathic matrix of 65785 (figure 7). Dowty et al. (1974) reported ion probe Pb-Pb age data by Anderson and Hinthorne for three armalcolite grains in the troctolite clast.

Norman et al. (2006) reported an Ar/Ar plateau age of  $3.83 \pm 0.02$  b.y. (figure 8).

## Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

Eldridge et al. (1974) found the cosmic ray induced activity for  $^{22}$ Na = 45 dpm/kg. and  $^{26}$ Al = 59 dpm/kg.

#### Summary of Age Data for 65785

Pb/Pb Ar/Ar Schaeffer and Schaeffer 1977  $3.97 \pm 0.02$  b.y. Anderson and Hinthorne 4.0 in Dowty et al. 1974 Norman et al. 2006  $3.83 \pm 0.02$ 

Note: old decay constant for K.

Schaeffer and Schaeffer (1977) determined a cosmic ray exposure age of 271 m.y.
