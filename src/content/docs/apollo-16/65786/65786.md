### **Introduction**

65786 and 65787 are rake samples from station 5 – see sections on 65501 and 65701.

The importance of these two samples is that they appear to look like Apollo 14 breccias. However, they have not been studied, nor analyzed.

### **Petrography**

Ryder and Norman (1989) describe 65786 as: *"a coherent, medium grey, polymict breccia with abundant glass in the matrix. Slickensides and abundant*  *fractures are present on four surfaces. Greenish, vesicular glass thinly coats the other surfaces."* 

Figure 3 illustrates the dark brown, glassy matrix with abundant small clasts – mostly plagioclase-rich.

65787 appears similar (to this author), but it appears to have a ribbon of glass interior to the sample.
