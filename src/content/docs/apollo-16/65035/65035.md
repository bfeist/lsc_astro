#### **Introduction**

65035 is a breccia with large clasts of light-colored cataclastic anorthosite intermixed with dark-colored basaltic impact melt. It is covered or coated with a thick glass coat on one side (figure 1). Although a slab was cut through the middle, 65035 has not been studied. The anorthositic portion is lithologically similar to 65315, a rake sample collected nearby (Sutton 1981).

65035 was a glass coated bomb that landed on the regolith while the glass was apparently still molten allowing welding of fine regolith material (figure 1). The side that was exposed to space experienced meteorite bombardment to erode the glass coating (figure 2). However, photos of the sample on the lunar surface show the glass side facing upward. This must be recent, because there are generally no zap pits on the smooth shiny glass.

An age of 2.29 m.y. indicates that this rock was derived from South Ray Crater.

#### **Petrography**

Photographs of the interior of 65035 (figures 4 and 7), show that it has two main lithologies (in addition to the glass coating). The dark lithology has a basaltic texture (figure 5) and the light lithology is cataclastic

anorthosite (figure 6) of the ferroan type. 65035 is typical of the "dilithic breccia" from this location. James (1980) termed these materials "dimict breccias".

Schaal et al. (1979) and Ryder and Norman (1980) give a brief petrologic description.

#### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* not reported

*Pyroxene:* McGee (1993) reported pyroxene content of anorthositic portion (figure 3). Ryder and Norman (1980) also reported an analysis by Schaal of pyroxene (Wo2 En63).

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase is reported as An96-97 (determined by Schaal), reported in Ryder and Norman (1980). McGee (1993) determined the Mg and Fe content (figure 8).

*Glass:* Schaal et al. (1979), See et al. (1986) and Morris et al. (1986) reported on the glass coating.

#### **Chemistry**

Rancitelli et al. (1973a) determined the bulk composition of the whole sample. Morris et al. (1986) analyzed the glass coat (figure 11). The interior impact melt and anorthositic breccia have apparently never

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Rancitelli et al. (1973b) determined the cosmic-rayinduced activity of 22Na = 49 dpm/kg. and 26Al = 172 dpm/kg. Eugster (1999) determined a cosmic ray exposure age of 2.29 ± 0.5 m.y. by the 38Ar method.

#### **Processing**

A slab was cut across the sample in 1989 (see trace in figures 1 and 2). There are 26 thin sections. It is apparently a rock of the James Consortium.
