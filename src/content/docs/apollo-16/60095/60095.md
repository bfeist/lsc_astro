### **Introduction**

Lunar sample 60095 was observed sitting on the lunar surface while placing the heat flow probe in the deep drill hole at Apollo 16 (Sutton 1981). It is a glass sphere that measures about 2.6 cm in diameter and is partly broken showing large vesicles inside (figure 1). Part of the surface is covered with micrometeorite craters.

### **Petrography**

Schaal et al. (1979abs), Mehta and Goldstein (1979) and Ryder and Norman (1980) describe 60095 as a broken sphere made of yellow-green to light brown glass with numerous internal vesicles. The outer surface is smooth, having formed by cooling in a vacuum, but with some cooling cracks and micrometeorite pits.

The internal glass is generally not devitrified except where there are residual inclusions of plagioclase that act as nucleation sites for devitrification. Small rounded bleb of metal with associated troilite and schreibersite are abundant, ranging in size from ~ 50 microns down to a few angstroms. Strings of metal particles are sometimes aligned in flow planes (schlieren).

### **Mineralogy**

*Glass:* The sphere is almost entirely homogeneous glass with only minor schlieren.

*Metallic Iron:* Two types of metal particles were found in 60095 glass (Mehta and Goldstein 1979). Finely divided metal/sulfide particles as small as 150 angstroms were observed in ion-thinned foils of 60095 glass. They range in Ni content 17 to 57%. Tiny cubes of Fe metal about <500 microns were found to be Ni free.

### **Chemistry**

See et al. (1986) and Morris et al. (1986) determined the composition of 60095 (table 1). Ganapathy et al. (1974) determined trace elements. It is similar in composition to other glass thought to be ejecta from South Ray Crater and similar to bulk soil composition (figure 2).

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Using a depth profiling technique Warhaut et al. (1979) found high 22Ne <50 angstroms below the surface, but little or no 4 He.

Neukum et al. (1973) and Brownlee et al. (1975) studied the micrometeorite craters that populate the top surface of 60095 (figures 3 and 4).

### **Processing**

Sample 60095 was cut with a wire saw (figures 5 and 6). Various pieces broke off because of the pressure of the vise during sawing. These pieces were where the greatest density of micrometeorite pits were located and studied.
