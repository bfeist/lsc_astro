### **Introduction**

Lunar soil 61220 is different from other lunar soil samples. It is an immature soil that was taken from bottom of a trench dug on the east rim of Plum Crater. The depth is uncertain, but less than 30 cm (figure 1). Soil 61220 is lighter in color than the surface soil (61240) (Morris et al. 1983).

Based on outgassing properties (trace CN), Gibson and Moore (1973) speculated that this soil might include cometary material, but this hypothesis has not been confirmed by other investigators (see, for example, Epstein and Taylor 1973). However, this soil is unusual in several respects and the origin of its volatile content remains an enigma.

### **Petrography**

mineralogic mode of 61221 and its various grain sizes, is low (Is/FeO = 9.2)(Morris 1979). The average grain finding this sample unusual (figure 2). Houck (1982) size is large; 212 microns for 61220 and 117 microns and Heiken et al. (1973) found a high proportion of for 61240 (figure 3a,b). glass, but everyone agrees that the sample is low in agglutinate content. Ridley et al. (1973) reported that Cadenhead et al. (1977) found that 61221 had a high

et al. speculate that 61221 was created through a single impact event.

#### Glass

Ridley et al. (1973) and Meyer (1978) studied the glass particles in 61221. Ridley et al. argued that clusters in glass composition allowed them to identify "Highland Basalt" and other "rock types". However, the composition of "Highland Basalt" closely matches the composition of the bulk soil (figures 14 and 15). Meyer attempted to show that "average" glass composition is contaminated by trace elements, because at least some of the glass is made from the regolith or from breccia (mixtures).

#### **Coarse Fines**

Marvin and Mosie (1980) made a catalog of coarse fines (1-4 mm) from 61220 and these have been subsequently investigated by various labs. Marvin

(1972) included coarse-fines from 61240 in her catalog of 4-10 mm particles. Several small rocks from these soils were given individual sample numbers and are briefly described in the Apollo 16 Rock Sample Catalogs by Butler (1972) and Ryder and Norman (1980).

Marvin and Warren (1980) studied the particles of pristine "micro-gabbro" found in the coarse fines (table 3). 61224,6 is composed of  $\sim$ 63% pyroxene (0.2 – 3 mm) and  $\sim$ 34% plagioclase (0.3 – 1 mm). Plagioclase is An<sub>83</sub> and pyroxene is En<sub>65</sub>Fs<sub>32</sub>Wo<sub>3</sub> and En<sub>43</sub>Fs<sub>17</sub>Wo<sub>40</sub>. Takeda et al. (1981) studied the nature of the exsolved pyroxene in 61224,6, discussing the cooling history.

#### **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of 61221 was originally reported by LSPET (1973), Bansal et al. (1972), Haskin et al. (1973), Rose et al. (1973) and others (table 1). Boynton et al. (1976) provided a complete analysis for 61241 (table 2). Finkelman et al. (1975) and Korotev et al. (1981) also measured the composition of the fine fraction from these samples, and Rhodes et al. (1975) studied the agglutinates in 61241. These soils are highly aluminous (figure 4). 61241 has a higher trace element content than 61221, from the bottom of the trench (tables 1 and 2, figure 5).

*Figure 9: Carbon and hydrogen in 61221 compared with other lunar soils (from Epstein and Taylor 1973).* 

Gibson and Moore (1973b) give the sulfur content of 61221 as 496 ppm. Jovanovic and Reed (1973) studied the halogens in 61221 and 61241 finding that they were within the range of other Apollo 16 materials. Allen et al. (1974) found that 204Pb, Bi, Tl and Zn were within the overall range of Apollo 16 soils.

Mark et al. (1973) and Nyquist et al. (1973) determined the Rb, Sr and K contents and Sr isotopic composition for 61221 and 61241.

61221 has relatively high carbon content (~100 ppm) for its maturity (Moore et al. 1973, figure 6). Gibson and Moore (1973a) and Wszolek et al. (1973) studied the temperature release of volatiles from 61221 (figures 7, 8 a,b,c). These temperature release patterns are different from that of other lunar materials, with more carbon based molecules coming off at a lower temperature. Gibson and Moore speculated that the volatiles might have a cometary origin, while Wszolek et al. interpreted this unusual volatile pattern might be from an impact by a carbonaceous chondrite. However, DesMarais et al. (1973) found the carbon content and species similar to that of other lunar soils.

Epstein and Taylor (1973) found that the H/D isotope ratio was like that of terrestrial water (figure 11) and provide an indepth discussion of the H, C and oxygen isotope measurements with respect to Gibson and Moore's cometary hypothesis. Sill et al. (1974) have also suggested a cometary origin for gas trapped in 78155. But no firm evidence has been established.

Becker et al. (1976) determined the nitrogen isotope ratio as a function of release temperature (figure 10).

Krahenbuhl et al. (1973) and Ganapathy et al. (1974) give concentrations for three small particles from 61222.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Walton et al. (1973) determined the cosmic ray exposure age of 61221 and 61241 by 21Ne as 250 m.y. and 240 m.y., respectively. Imamura et al. (1974) studied 54Mn in both samples finding that they were consistent with the 54Mn depth profiles of deep drill samples. The main conclusion is that both sample are saturated with 54Mn activities predicted for their depth and must have remain exposed and relatively undisturbed for >5 m.y. (perhaps the age of Plum Crater).

Fireman et al. (1973) reported 37Ar, 39Ar and 3 H, while Fields et al. (1973) studied the interaction of the cosmic-ray flux with U.

### **Other Studies**

Taylor and Epstein (1973) studied the isotopic composition of silicon and oxygen removed by partial fluorination and compared results with surface soils.

Bogard and Nyquist (1973), Walton et al. (1973) and Nautiyal et al. (1981) determined rare gas contents of 61221 and found that 61221 had considerable excess 40Ar and 4 He.

Fleischer and Hart (1974) and Rao et al. (1979) determined the density of cosmic-ray tracks in 61221 (figure 13).

### **Processing**

Soils 61220 and 61240 were brought back in ALSRC#1, but it did not seal and the samples were exposed to spacecraft (LM and CM) and Pacific Ocean atmospheres. A fairly large portion of 61220 remains unsieved. There is a note in the inventory that 61220 contains "clods".

Several small rocks were removed – see table.
