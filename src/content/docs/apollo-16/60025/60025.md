#### **Introduction**

cataclastic anorthosite (figure 1). Or, rather, it is a 86Sr (0.699). mixture of pieces from a related sequence of anorthosites, because the mafic minerals vary in Ferroan anorthosites are one of the major lunar rock composition (**Ryder 1982**, James et al. 1991). Warren types (Dowty et al. 1974, James 1980) and are thought and Wasson (1977) termed 60025 "pristine" because to be pieces of the original lunar crust formed by of its coarse grain size and low meteoritic siderophiles plagioclase floatation from a moon-wide magma ocean (Ni, Ir). The age of 60025 has been determined by Pb- (e.g. Smith et al. 1970, Wood et al. 1970, Warren 1990).

Lunar sample 60025 is a large sample of coarse-grained Pb and Sm-Nd to be 4.36 b.y. and it has very low 87Sr/

Alternatively, 60025 may be from a layered igneous pluton emplaced within the lunar crust (James 1980).

Ryder and Norman (1980) provided a compilation of what was known about 60025 up to that time. James et al. (1991) studied the mafic portions of 60025.

60025 was collected near the Lunar Module and its orientation was documented by photography.

#### **Petrography**

60025 has been described as a moderately shocked, cataclastic anorthosite (Hodges and Kushiro 1973, Walker et al. 1973, Dixon and Papike 1975, **Ryder 1982**, James et al. 1991) made up of mostly calcic plagioclase (see mode). The first slabs cut from 60025 were nearly pure plagioclase (figure 2), but other portions of 60025 were found to be more mafic (see Warren and Wasson 1977, Ryder 1982, James et al. 1991). Most pyroxene grains are distinct augite or orthopyroxene, but some grains are exsolved into end member components (figure 3). There are trace amounts of silica, ilmenite and chromite.

A variety of textures are reported (figure 3). In some areas, large fractured plagioclase grains (2-4 mm) sit in a sea of crushed plagioclase and pyroxene (Walker et al. 1973).

Pyroxene compositions are variable in different portions of the rock ( $\rm En_{50}$  to  $\rm En_{70}$ ) indicating a differentiation sequence (Ryder 1982). However, the origin of some pyroxene by sub-solidus exsolution should be considered (see Smith and Steele 1974). The wide composition gap between augite and hypersthene ( $\rm Wo_{45}$  to  $\rm Wo_2$ ) indicates thermal equilibrium well below magmatic temperatures (Walker et al 1973, Dixon and Papike 1975), presumably as a slowly-cooled plutonic rock.

#### **Mineralogy**

**Plagioclase**: A number of people have analyzed the plagioclase in 60025 and found it to be uniform and very calcic (An<sub>96,98</sub>) (see table for some of the analyses).

*Olivine*: Warren and Wasson (1977), Ryder (1982) and James et al. (1991) find that olivine in various portions of 60025 has a range of compositions (Fo42-66).

*Pyroxene*: Pyroxene is present as subhedral to anhedral grains included in plagioclase, as anhedral grains at grain boundaries and in mafic clumps with olivine. 60025 contains both high-Ca and low-Ca pyroxene with a wide miscibility gap (figure 4). Hodges and Kushiro (1973) noted that three pyroxenes (augite, hypersthene and pigeonite) were probably present at time of crystallization. Pigeonite is now exsolved to endmember compositions. Fine exsolution is also found in sub-calcic augite (Hodges and Kushiro 1973). Dixon and Papike (1975) find that the composition of coexisting augite and orthopyroxene indicates an equilibrium temperature of less than 800 deg. C (see also Lindsley et al. 1974). Floss et al. (1998) determined the REE for pyroxenes in 60025 (figure 6).

The variation of FeO/MgO in pyroxene, from one portion of 60025 to another, is the evidence used by Ryder (1982) to argue that 60025 may actually be a mix of anorthosites from a differentiated sequence.

*Opaques*: Hodges and Kushiro (1973) and James et al. (1991) determined the composition of chromite and ilmenite.

*Glass*: The black glass found attached to the surface of 60025 has been studied by See et al. (1986) and Morris et al. (1986).

#### **Chemistry**

Plagioclase dominates the composition of 60025 (figures 6 and 9). Haskin et al. (1973, 1981) and Krahenbuhl et al. (1973) showed that 60025 was free of meteoritic siderophile elements (Ni, Ir). James et al. (1991) determined the composition of mafic portions of 60025 (table 1).

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

Tera and Wasserburg (1972), Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1972), Nunes et al. (1974), Schaeffer and Husain (1974), Hanan and Tilton (1987) and Carlson and Lugmair (1988) have attempted to date 60025. The 87Sr/86Sr ratio is extremely (0.699) low indicating that 60025 is very old and formed from a low Rb source (Nyquist et al. 1974). The mafic minerals allowed a precise Sm/Nd isochron (figure 7), which is only about 110 m.y. younger than the age of the moon. However, the interpretation that 60025 is in fact a mix of related anorthosites, this is perhaps equivalent to a "whole rock" isochron.

The exact age of 60025 has been recently (2011) reinvestigated by Pb/Pb and Nd/Sm and found to be significantly younger (4.36 b.y.) than previously thought (Borg et al. 2011).

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Kurt Marti determined the exposure age of 60025 as 1.9 m.y. (see Drozd et al. 1977 and Arvidson et al. 1975). Fruchter et al. (1977) and Kohl et al. (1977) determined 53Mn in 60025 as 105 ± 13 and 76 ± 6 dpm/ kg respectively.

#### **Other Studies**

Sato (1986) determined the intrinsic oxygen fugacity of 60025. Flory et al. (1973) studied the hydrocarbons that were emitted during heating of 60025 (apparently produced by hydrolysis of solar wind implanted carbon). Schaeffer and Husain (1974), Lightner and Marti (1974) and Leich and Niemeyer (1975) analyzed the rare gases in 60025. Katsube and Collett (1973), Gold et al. (1976) and Cisowski et al. (1976) determined electrical and magnetic properties. Hapke et al. (1978) collected ultraviolet reflectance spectra. Simmons et al. (1975) studied the microcracks and Jeanloz and Ahrens (1978) studied the compressibility (equation of state). Sondergeld et al. (1979) determined seismic wave velocities to compare with seismic data collected at Apollo 16.

### **Processing**

Two thick slabs have been cut from 60025 (figures 2 and 10) and several pieces are used in public displays (see flow diagram). Mafic-rich pieces were taken from the side opposite the slabs (W1).
