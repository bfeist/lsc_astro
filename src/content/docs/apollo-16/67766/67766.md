## **Introduction**

67766 is a rake sample collected from the rim of North Ray Crater – see section on 67701. It is a coherent, plagioclase-rich breccia with a granular matrix. It has a measured age of 3.82 b.y.

## **Petrography**

Steele and Smith (1973) noted that their section of 67766 had olivine (figure 3), but no pyroxene, while Stoffler et al. (1985) found pyroxene but no olivine. However, they do agree that 67766 is a "recrystallized breccia" (figure 2).

## **Chemistry**

None

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Stoffler et al. (1985) dated this small rock at about 3.82 – 3.83 b.y. by Ar/Ar (figure 4). They noted an older age for the included plagioclase grains.
