*Figures 1 a,b: Front and back of 61546. Cube is 1 cm. S72-43422 and 424.* 

## **Introduction**

61546 was collected as a rake sample from near Plum Crater (figure 2) – see section on 61500. It is a vesicular chunk of glass with numerous small white clast. (figure 1 a,b). There are micrometeorite craters on one side only.

## **Petrography**

The interior matrix of 61546 is an apahnitc melt that has partially crystallized. It is probably an impact melt from a small crater in the regolith. Hunter and Taylor (1980) report minor rust.
