LMP: *I don't want to get down there to far. This thing is deep. I'm to the 2:30 position of the rover, and I'm going to start with this double core – got it assembled. Okay. I pushed it in. I got in almost to the top of the first stem by pushing it in.*

LMP: *Okay, Tony, about halfway up the second one – it's getting a little harder, but it's going on in.*

#### Introduction

Samples from station 4, high up on Stone Mountain, should primarily be materials from the Descartes Formation (Muehlberger et al. 1980). A double drive tube (~60 cm) was taken in loose, blocky, regolith on the rim of a 15 meter crater (figure 1). Soil sample 64500, rake 64530, trench 64420 and several rocks were collected adjacent to this double drive tube (figure 2).

However, a ray from South Ray Crater extends in this direction and the blocky area were these sample were taken may have been caused by ejecta from South Ray Crater (samples 64425, 64455, 64475 etc.).

The core has three chemically distinct regions (top 20 cm, 20 to 48 cm and 48 to 60 cm).

#### **Petrography**

Horz et al. (1972) and Mahmood et al. (1974) noted a change in grain size and an abundance of rock fragments at a depth of 50 cm. A nearby penetrometer experiment also noted a change in penetration resistance at about 50 cm (Mitchell et al. 1972).

Morris and Lauer (1982) and Korotev et al. (1984) reported the maturity along the length of the double drive tube (figure 3), noting several distinct changes. The top 12 cm seems to be 'disturbed', possibly 2 m.y.

ago by the ray from South Ray Crater. Overall, the core has high maturity.

Analysis of the modal data by Houck (1982) and Basu and McKay (1984) indicates that the upper and lower portions of 64002 may have had different source rocks (Papike et al. 1982). Houck (1982) suggests that the soils formed by mixing a plagioclase-rich soil with two different mature soils. Note that there is little to no observable mare basalt component in the mode, because the mare component is present in glass and dark matrix breccias.

Nishiizumi et al. (1982) conclude that the top 20 cm was recently disturbed (~ 3 m.y. ago).

#### **Chemistry**

According to Korotev (1984), the station 4 core has three chemically distinct regions (top 20 cm, 20 to 48 cm and 48 to 60 cm). These are compared with the chemistry of 64501 in table 1 and figure 5. Korotev (1984) reports an enrichment in the mare component in the region form 26 to 48 cm. compared with the deeper material. There is a thin layer at about 43 cm depth that has as much as 12 % mare basalt (according

to Korotev et al. 1984). This is higher than anywhere else at Apollo 16.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Nishiizumi et al. (1983) determined 53Mn along the length of the core 64002 (figure 8). They seem to have found that the top of the core had been recently "disturbed", which would also apply to the trench soil, 64421 (which also seems to be unusually mature at depth).
