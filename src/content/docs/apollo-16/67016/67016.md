## **Introduction**

67016 is a feldspathic fragmental breccia with both light and dark clasts (figures 1 and 17) collected from the lip of North Ray Crater (Ulrich 1973; Muehlberger et al. 1980). This large rock is thought to be analogous to terrestrial suevite (impact breccia). It is *not* a regolith breccia, because it has relatively low Ni, Ir and Au, low rare gas content and low maturity (Is /FeO).

67016 is 3.95 b.y. old with an exposure age of 50 m.y. (the apparent age of North Ray Crater). It contains, as a plutonic igneous clast, the oldest lunar sample dated (4.56 b.y.). It also contains a trace-element-rich clast termed "sodic ferrogabbro" as well as numerous other lithic clasts.

The breccias from North Ray Crater are diverse in nature; as are the clasts in 67016 (Lindstrom and Salpas 1983).

## **Petrography**

Nord et al. (1975) describe 67016 as a porous breccia with dark-lithic clasts and lighter plagioclase fragments. The porous light-colored matrix that envelopes the clasts consist mostly of plagioclase with minor pyroxene and olivine. Ilmenite is polycrystalline and heavily deformed. Nord et al. reported that "small 100 micron granitic fragments were very common in the matrix and have reacted with the matrix to produce narrow pyroxene reaction rims".

Norman (1981) provided an overview of the petrography of 67016 and determined that it is analogous to a terrestrial suevite. It is a light-gray breccia with approximately 20% dark melt clasts and 10% white lithic clasts (2 to 5 cm) and scattered single grains of plagioclase, mafic minerals and rare opaques set in a fine-grained, seriate matrix. It has a brecciasin-breccia texture (figure 3) with numerous light and dark clasts (figure 4). The lithic clasts include feldspathic granulitic impactite, ferroan anorthosite, subophitic impact melt and a variety of other types. According to Norman (1981), the matrix around metal grains in 67016 is stained a dull orange (rust?). Hunter and Taylor (1981) also reported abundant rust(?) on metal grains in 67016.

Figure 2 shows 67016 perched in the rim of North ray Crater. Micrometeorite craters and surface patina are reported on unabraded exterior surfaces (Ryder and Norman 1980 and Norman and Garcia 1981) and indicate that the rock was "tumbled" on the lunar surface.

Takeda et al. (1990) compared 67016 with lunar meteorite Y86032.

Norman et al. (1991) and Norman and Taylor (1992) describe sodic noritc anorthosite clasts in 67016. One of these (,326/8) was dated to be very old (Alibert et al. 1994).

*Figure 3: Photomicrgraph if thin section of 67016 showing "breccia-in-breccia" texture. Norman (1981) likened this to "suevite" often found at terrestrial craters.* 

Lindstrom and Salpas (1981) analyzed a unique clast they termed "sodic ferrogabbro". Norman (1981) terms this material "ilmenite-silica" gives the mode and mineral compositions.

## **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* The olivine in 67016 ranges in composition from Fo58 to Fo78 (figure 5).

*Ilmenite:* Nord et al. (1975) found that minor ilmenite in 67016 was "polycrystalline".

*Plagioclase:* Norman (1981) determined the composition of numerous plagioclase grains in the matrix, melt breccia, granulitic clasts and plutonic clasts (figure 6). The plutonic clasts were An95-98 while matrix etc. ranged from An82-98.

*Pyroxene:* Norman (1981) and Takeda et al. (1990) determined the composition of pyroxene grains in clasts and matrix of 67016 (figure 5).

*Metallic Iron:* Hunter and Taylor (1981) reported iron grains with rust (?)

## **Chemistry**

Norman and Taylor (1992) determined the composition of many units and clasts in 67016. Note that their analyses for K, U and Th for a bulk sample (2.2 grams) agrees with the radiation counting by Eldridge et al. (1975) for a 482 gram piece (table 1a). They also give

an analysis of the ferroan noritic anorthosite clast that they dated (,326/8). Lindstrom and Salpas (1983) also analyzed a large number of splits of 67016 (table 1b), including a rare-earth-rich "sodic ferrogabbro clast" (,289, figure 7).

Gibson and Chang (1974) found a trace of carbonate in 67016 by temperature release (figure 9) and determined the isotopic composition of carbon and oxygen. However Gibson and Andrawes (1978) only found nitrogen by crushing.

Meteoritic siderophiles are moderately abundant (Ir = 1-3 ppm), but less than for a regolith breccia (Hertogen et al. 1977).

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Turner and Cadogen (1975) and Alibert et al. (1994) have dated materials from 67016. Turner and Cadegen determined an age of 3.95 ± 0.07 b.y. for a dark clast (figure 10) while Alibert et al. found that a ferroan

noritic anorthosite clast was as old as 4.562 ± 0.068 b.y. (figure 11).

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Turner and Cadogen (1975) determined an 38Ar-37Ar exposure age of 50 m.y. Eldridge et al. (1975) reported the cosmic-ray induced activity for 26Al = 88 dpm/kg., 22Na = 35dpm/kg. and 54Mn = 15 dpm/kg. Bhandari et al. (1973) reported track densities and a "suntan age" of about 1 m.y. and calculate that 67016 has spent less than 15 m.y. within the top 10 cm of the lunar regolith.

Indeed, North Ray Crater has been shown to be ~ 50 m.y. old!

## **Other Studies**

Pearce et al. (1973) determined the magnetic properties and found fairly stable remenant magnetization.

Housley et al. (1976) found that this rock did not have significant intensity of FMR (I /FeO). s

# **Processing**

Ryder and Norman (1980) summarized the analytical work to that time. Norman and Garcia (1981) described the pieces of 67016 in "guidebook #5" and give a full genealogy diagram. This rock sample was never sawn for fear of Pb contamination. Instead the sample was "picked apart", much like a communion loaf. 67016,1 is currently 2500 grams big – and ready for more work!

67016 was returned, along with 61016, in the big bag called the BSLSS. There were 360 grams of fines in the residue of this bag. Imagine the confusion! There are 43 thin sections of 67016.
