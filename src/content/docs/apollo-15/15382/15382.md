### **Introduction**

15382 is a pristine feldspathic basalt with high rareearth-element content. Only a few pristine samples of this important rock type were returned from the moon, also including 15386 and fragments in 15434 and other Apollo 15 soils (Meyer 1972). These fragments were recognized as samples of chilled volcanic liquid and have been a source of much speculation (Meyer 1977, Ryder 1987, Papike et al. 1997). *Although 14310 was generally similar, it had high meteoritical siderophile content and is nonpristine.* 

15382 was collected, along with 15386, as part of a rake sample from the soil just inside the rim of Spur Crater, Apollo 15. Meyer (1977), Warren and Wasson (1979), Ryder (1985) and Papike et al. (1998) provide reviews of what was known about KREEP basalt. Spudis (1978) and Ryder (1994) suggest that the source of the Apollo 15 KREEP basalt fragments might be the Apennine Front Formation and speculate that KREEP volcanism might have been triggered by the Imbrium impact (same age ?).

### **Petrography**

The texture of 15382 is that of a fine-grained subophitic basalt (figure 2). Thin plagioclase laths (0.2 to 0.8 mm long) are intergrown with chemcialy zoned pyroxene (Dowty et al. 1976; Crawford and Hollister 1977). Large patches of mesostasis are present, consisting of ilmenite, high-Si glass, cristobalite, tranquillityite, armalcolite, baddeleyite, whitlockite, apatite and Cr-ulvöspinel (Nehru et al. 1974, Dowty et al. 1976).

It is clear from the texture of 15382, that pyroxene and plagioclase crystallized together, as along a cotectic on a phase diagram. During the crystallization, the residual liquid separated into two immiscible liquids, one Fe-rich and the other Si-rich, which are found as inclusions in plagioclase (Hollister and Crawford 1977). They find that liquid immiscibility may have occurred after only 20% of the liquid had crystallized!

Ryder (1987) discusses the petrographic evidence for nonlinear cooling rates for some of the other Apollo 15 KREEP basalt fragments, and thus, by inference, a

volcanic origin for all of the pristine Apollo 15 KREEP basalts (including 15382 and 15386). Indeed, Dowty et al. (1976) reported one grain of plagioclase in 15382 with a relict homogeneous core (An<sub>95</sub>).

#### **Mineralogy**

**Pyroxene**: The cores of pyroxene crystals are Mgrich orthopyroxene, which are surrounded by zoned pigeonite (figure 3).

**Plagioclase**: Plagioclase is strongly zoned  $(An_{90-70})$  and has  $K_2O$  contents ranging from 0.25% interior to 0.5% at rims. FeO and MgO are also elevated and it is clear the plagioclase formed quickly. Glass inclusions are found in the outer rims of the plagioclase laths

(Hollister and Crawford 1977). Dowty et al. (1976) reported one plagioclase (0.5 x 0.2mm) with  $An_{95}$ .

*Opaques*: Analyses for ilmenite and Cr-ulvöspinel are reported in Nehru et al. (1974).

*Glass*: The intersticies between plagioclase and pyroxene contain yellow glass. The glass is potassic (6-8% K<sub>2</sub>O) and silica-rich (70-75% SiO<sub>2</sub>), but with exsolved blebs of Fe-rich glass (Dowty et al. 1976; Hollister and Crawford 1977).

**Metal**: Dowty et al. (1976) found small grains of iron metal in the mesostasis and in troilite. The metal in 15382 was found to have very low Ni content (<0.3%).

# **Chemistry**

The composition of 15382 is silica rich and high in large-ion-lithophile elements (K, Th, Zr, REE). The distinctive REE pattern is parallel to the "KREEP" pattern from other sites (Warren and Wasson 1979) (figure 4). 15382 and other KREEP basalts also have relatively high Mg/Fe ratios, such that they can not be simply derived by partial melting (McKay and Weill 1976).

Gros et al. (1976) found very low content of Ni, Ir, Au and Re in 15382, such that this pristine rock has not had an added meteoritic component *(as has been the case for most KREEP).* 

## **Radiogenic age dating**

15382 has been dated by the 39/40Ar plateau technique by Turner et al. (1973) and Stettler et al. (1973) (figures 5 and 6). Tera and Wasserburg (1976) and

Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1976, 1977) reported K, Rb, Sr and Pb isotopes on 2 mg of 15382 and have also reported a mineral isochron by Rb/Sr (see table).

Lugmair and Carlson (1978) determined the whole rock Sm and Nd isotopic composition and calculated the "whole rock" age at ~ 4.4 b.y. which is interpreted as the closure age of the initial global scale lunar differentiation (see also Carlson and Lugmair 1979).

Lee et al. (1997) determined the W isotopes in 15382 and other lunar samples.

Figure 7: Projection of phase diagram for Fe/Fe+Mg = 0.3 as determined by Walker et al. (1973), showing that the compsition of 15382 is near the cotectic between pyroxene and plagioclase (figure from Meyer 1977).

The crystallization age of Apollo 15 KREEP basalts (~3.9 b.y.) is indistinguishable from the age of the Imbrium basin.

### Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

Stettler et al. (1973) and Turner et al. (1973) determined the exposure age of 15382 as 230 m.y. and 240 m.y. respectively by  $^{38}$ Ar technique. O'Kelley et al. (1976) determined  $^{26}$ Al =  $74 \pm 20$  dpm/kg.

#### **Other Studies**

Walker et al. (1973) showed that KREEP basalt was formed by low-pressure melting (figure 7). Hess et al. (1978) studied the low pressure phase equilibria for 15382 composition and found that the liquidus occurs at 1180 deg. C with simultaneous crystallization of plagioclase (An<sub>85</sub>) and low-Ca pyroxene (Wo<sub>5</sub>En<sub>76</sub>Fs<sub>19</sub>). Ilmenite did not form until late in the crystallization sequence.

Haines and Weiss (1978) determined a fission track retention age of 3.2 b.y.

### **Processing**

15382 was apparently sawn to yield a thin slab for thin sections. There are only 3 thin sections.

Additional material can be found in the Apollo 15 soils.

#### **Summary of Age Data for 15382**

Ar/Ar Rb/Sr
