Lunar samples 15595 and 15596 were chipped from a in this area, with abundant rock samples (basalts) small boulder near the edge of Hadley Rille in an area exposed (Swann et al. 1971). However, both pigeonite called The Terrace (see transcript in 15597). The basalt and olivine-normative basalts were found in this boulder is thought to be "bedrock" in this region location. (equivalent to the outcrops seen in telephoto of the other

## **Petrography**

Ryder (1985) describe both 15595 and 15596 as a "finegrained, porphyritic mare basalt with conspicuously irregularly distributed vugs (figures 1 and 2). Pigeonite phenocrysts are set in as spherulitic, almost vitrophyric groundmass. - - - The sample is olive gray to olive black, angular, and tough. The broken surface is hackly, the other are smoothed to irregular and have zap pits (micrometeorite craters)". Vugs make up 15 to 30 % of volume.

15596 has the same texture but with somewhat larger pyroxenes, and a groundmass that is more crystalline. Brown et al. (1972) described the groundmass as made up of "clinopyroxene, plagioclase and opaques, with occasional rare zoned olivine and Cr-spinel microphenocrysts."

The larger pyroxene phenocrysts have homogeneous pigeonite cores, with a sharp transition to sub-calcic augite rims. The fine groundmass pyroxene are zoned to Fe-rich pyroxferroite (Brown et al. 1973).

Lofgren et al. (1975, 1976) and Grove and Walker (1977) have studied the cooling history of vitrophyric pigeonite basalts.

### **Chemistry**

Fruchter et al. (1973) and Chappell and Green (1973) analyzed 15595 (figures 7 and 8). Rhodes and Blanchard (1983) reported that they had analyzed 15596, but gave no data.

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Behrmann et al. (1972) and Pepin et al. (1974) determined a cosmic ray exposure age of 110 m.y. by 81Kr method.

### **Other Studies**

Behrmann et al. (1972), Pepin et al. (1974) and Drozd et al. (1974) measured the isotopic ratios of all of the rare gas elements and studied the spallation reactions of the rock with solar and galactic cosmic rays.

Gose et al. (1972) and Pearce et al. (1973) measured the magnetic properties of 15595 and 15596, finding that the direction of remanent magnetizations was different for the two sample (of the same boulder?).

Sato et al. (1973) measured the oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature by an *insitu* technique.

#### **Processing**

A slab was cut through the middle of 15595 (figure 9) and cut into columns. 15596 remains essentially intact. There are 10 thin sections for 15595 and 5 for 15596.
