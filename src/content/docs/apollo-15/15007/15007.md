## **Introduction**

The total depth of the 15007/8 double drive tube is 56.6 cm. It was collected from the rim of a 10 meter shallow crater at the highest point on the Apennine Front at station 2, Apollo 15 (figure 1) close to the location of reference soil (15220), and other soil samples including 15091, 15101, 15201, 15211, 15231 collected nearby (see section on 15100). Station 2 was on the outer flank of St. George Crater which punched deep into the Apennine Front material.

15008 is the top segment of the double drive tube, and 15007 is the bottom segment. 15007 was found to contain immature, glass-rich and more aluminous soil at about 55 cm depth.

The 15008/7 double drive tube was the first taken with the new 4.13 cm diameter assembly (Mitchell et al. 1972). The soil material did not fall out and was less disturbed, because it did not have to "flow" past a lip as was the case in previous missions. Papike et al. (1982) included 15007/8 in their set of reference soils. *Figure 2: Maturity of soil as function of depth in*

## **Petrography**

The maturity index (Is /FeO) of 15008/7 varies as a function of depth (figure 2). There are more agglutinates in the top of the core than the bottom and the average grain size is also variable (figure 3). Graf (1992) reported the grain size studies (figure 10). Nagle (1980, 1981a,b) gives a description of the core during dissection and Basu et al. (1988) give the detailed model mineralogy (see table). The only notable result is that there was a lot (26 %) of green glass in the 55 cm horizon.

During dissection, Nagle (1981) separated several apparently pristine rock fragments from the bottom of 15007. Portions of these were studied by Warren et al. (1983). Some of these separated particles were KREEP basalt, while others were "anorthosite".

Mutispectral imaging by Pieters et al. (1981) revealed a feldspathic fragment-rich zone with a chaotic fabric that occurs between 10 and 18 cm depth. Figure 13 is

The composition of individual pyroxene grains shows that KREEP basalt is a major component of the Apennine Front (figure 4).

## **Chemistry**

The bottom of the core (15007) is more aluminous and less mafic than the surface soils (Korotev 1987). The composition of the top (15008) has not been reported, but one can assume it is the same as the surface soil (15201).

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Nishiizumi et al. (1989), Jull et al. (1998) and Fruchter et al. (1982) studied 36Cl, 14C and 26Al (respectively) as function of depth (figures 6 - 8).

## **Other Studies**

Bogard et al. (1982) determined the rare gas content and isotopic ratios as function of depth. They concluded that the top 18 cm was deposited by the adjacent 10 meter crater, while the material 18 to 49 cm was the preexisting regolith, mass-wasted off of

## **Processing**

15007 and 15008 were returned in ALSRC#1 (sealed). 15008 was dissected, described and first distributed in 1980 (Nagle 1981a,b). Thin sections are available for the complete core (e.g. figure 13). Pb contamination was found to be severe.

"Sampling was easy (figure 9). The double drive tube was pushed almost to the depth of the lower drive tube (AS15-86-11577), then driven 2" per hammer blow to the full depth possible. The rammer was inserted 6" after sampling. There was no indication of spillage during uncoupling of the drive tubes or placing them into the return container SCB1. Because the drive tube was returned in as SCB, it was subjected to spacecraft cabin atmosphere for approximately 7 days. The core was placed in dry gN2 on August 10, 1971. It was Xrayed October 1979. There was slumping approximately 8 cm at the top of 15008. About 5.5 cm of compaction of 15008 occurred during extrusion. Bulk density of 15008 is 1.65 gm/cm3 and 15007 is 1.7 gm/cm3 ."

## Transcript core

*CDR Okay – next thing on the agenda is a double core.* 

*LMP Yes. Okay: I'm going to go over and configure for it.* 

*- - CDR Oh, we've got a good place here. We've got a fairly deep crater: it must be about 10 meters across, and a meter and a half or so deep, and we'll pick the rim of that – There's a fresh impact crater in – in the rim anyway, which like it pulled out some* 

*CDR Is that as far as you can push it, Jim?*

*LMP That's as far as I can push it. I got the picture: go ahead. CDR Okay. It's a – We've got one full core, second core is going in about 2 inches per hammer stroke.*

*CDR And we've got almost a second core. Got a couple of inches to go, Jim. Doing good. Okay: that's good, man. All the way in, Good show. Okay. Pull it out slowly. Nice. Nice. Easy does it. That's nice. Coming out very clean. Hold it steady. Got a good one. Okay. Come on over this way a little. Cap for it.*

*LMP Give me the cap. I'll put it on, Dave*

*CDR Okay. Good idea. Okay Rammer went in about 6 inches.*

*CC And Dave, we're standing by for a number on the core.*
