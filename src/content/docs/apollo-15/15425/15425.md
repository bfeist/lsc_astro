*The saga of the scientific study of a diverse collection of small green glass beads from Apollo 15 is a perfect example why, exactly, the laboratory analysis of samples returned from another planet is far superior to analysis done by remote means. The small variation in the chemistry of these beads required scientists to perfect their analytical and interpretative techniques – which can only be done with samples in hand! It has been said: Samples are like a" gift that keeps on giving."* 

# **Introduction**

in the samples collected from around Spur Crater on 15377) were collected as part of the rake sample (bag the Apennine Front, Apollo 15. Two large, greenish, 3/172) and the "soil" from this bag (15310 to 15314) friable clods found at Spur Crater were placed in a also contained a lot of green glass fragments due to documented bag and returned. When the bag was abrasion. The large soil 15300 – 4 was also found to opened, these friable clods were found broken into contain numerous green glass spheres and "green glass several pieces with considerable loose "soil" partially clods". Various soils, regolith breccias and cores from derived from the breakup of the clods (figure 1). The this site also contain an abundance of the same, green surviving clods were grouped and numbered 15425, glass beads. In general, there is more green glass in 15426 and 15427 (Butler 1971). The soil was sieved the samples on the Apennine Front than on the mare and numbered 15420 to 15424. Sample 15421 has surface (Nagle 1981, Basu et al. 1981). greater than 80% green glass beads (figure 2).

An abundance of small green glass spheres were found Additional clods of green glass (numbered 15365

Some portions of the green glass clods are nearly pure green glass, but other portions of these clods also contain various amounts of local (gray) regolith (figure 4). In addition, various yellow impact glasses, as well as red and yellow volcanic glasses, are also found in these glass clods (Delano 1980, Delano and Livi 1981, Spangler et al. 1984, Hughes et al. 1988).

At first, the green glass from Apollo 15 was found to be rather homogeneous (Reid et al. 1972, Warner et al. 1972, Ridley et al. 1973, Agrell et al. 1973, others, see tables). However, Stolper (1974), Hlava et al. (1973) and others found slight, but significant, variation in composition. The green glass beads were eventually found to be subdivided into 7 compositional groups (Delano 1979, Ryder 1986, Galbreath et al. 1990, Steele et al. 1992) (figure 5, table 2). Hlava et al. (1973) reported analysis of 263 green glass beads from soils and rake sample 15365. Delano (1979) analyzed 416 glass particles and grouped them into five groups based on their major element composition (verified by Ryder 1986). Ma et al. (1981) analyzed 55 for trace elements, establishing 3 groups. Galbreath et al. (1990) analyzed 70 green glass particles for both major and trace

elements. Steele et al. (1992) analyzed 365 by INAA and selected 52 of them for major elements – they now have 7 distinct groups of green glass!

Ryder (1985) reviewed the data on the green glass clods in his Apollo 15 catalog. The section on the Orange Soil (74220) also discusses volcanic glass found on the moon.

# **Petrography**

The green glass clods (15425, 15426 and 15427) are partially light-greenish-gray and partly grayish-brown – it is the greener parts that have been studied. In spite of a lot of work on these samples, there appears to be no basic description of these breccias in the literature (Ryder 1985). The clods are blocky and very friable,

with average particle size less than 0.1 mm. Sample 15426,26 (figure 3) is a friable, greenish-white clod with only ~5% glass beads set in a fine white matrix of powdery material (presumably fine fragments of broken glass). The greener portions of the clods are mostly green glass beads and broken fragments of green glass, but with occasional red or yellow glass beads (figure 4). The gray portions appear to be regolith breccia, with admixed basalt fragments. Green glass clods from the rake sample (15365-15377) were cataloged by Dowty et al. (1973) (figure 5).

The green glass beads have most recently been studied by Steele (1992), Steele et al. (1992) and Galbreath (1990) who confirm the detailed analyses by Delano (1979). These authors find that there are distinct compositional groupings of glass (figure 7, table 2).

Surface features of the green glass have been studied by McKay et al. (1973), Agrell et al. (1973), Meyer et al. (1975), Butler (1978) and others. The beads generally lack hypervelocity impact craters. Some beads form composite aggregates, indicating collision while molten in the volcanic plume. Most beads have

a distinct texture of micromounds due to a surface coating of condensed volatiles (figure 16, Meyer et al. 1975).

The green glass beads generally lack bubbles, but Delano and Lindsey (1983) found more than 20 vesiclebearing volcanic glass beads in 15427 (figure 6). Steele (1992), Basu et al. (1979) and Arndt et al. (1984) studied the fine-featured olivine microlites that form during quenching the green glass. Ridley et al. (1973) and Basu et al. (1979) found that the olivine crystallites in green glass were Fo70-76. Dyar (1984) studied the valence and coordination of iron in the glass during quenching experiments. All features were consistent with volcanic fire-fountaining.

The maturity index (Is/FeO) is less than 1 for 15426 (Morris 1976, McKay et al. 1984) – which is extremely low (as was the case for the Orange Soil). Stone et al. (1982) determined Is/FeO for individual glass beads, finding that it was a good discriminator for volcanic vrs. agglutinate glass.

Early on, the high Mg/Fe ratio and extremely low and flat rare-earth-element content attracted the attention of experimental petrologists whose experiments were aimed at learning the depth of origin of this primitive volcanic liquid. Green and Ringwood (1973) used previous experiments of Apollo 12 samples to predict the depth of origin (200 km) and degree of partial melting (30-60%) of the interior based on multiple saturation of orthopyroxene and olivine phases. Stolper (1974), Grove and Lindsley (1978), Grove (1981) and Longhi (1992) developed alternative models for the

origin of the green glass (figure 20). Delano (1980) established the multiple saturation of phases for the red glass (figure 21) giving a depth of origin of 500 km!!

The Ni in the green glass (and other mafic volcanic glass) is substantially higher than in mare basalt (Delano 1986) and Ni abundance correlates with MgO (figure 9).

Delano (1980) studied the red volcanic glass and Hughes et al. (1988) studied yellow-brown volcanic glass from 15427 (table 4).

Stone et al. (1982) determined Is/FeO for individual glass beads, finding that 9 out of 10 green glass beads from 15401 had negligible Is/FeO.

# **Surface-correlated Volatiles**

Meyer et al. (1975), Butler and Meyer (1976), Butler (1978), Cirlin and Housley (1979) found surface coatings of primarily ZnS on green glass beads. Morgan and Wandless (1984) found higher Cd, Zn, Se, Ag in the less than 37 micron size fraction indicating surface enrichment (figure 15). Ganapathy et al. (1973) showed that the green glass and especially the "finer matrix" of 15426 was enriched in volatile elements (Zn, Cd, Br, Se, Te, Ge, In, Tl, Bi, Ag and Sb). They also showed that Re and Ir seemed to track Zn and other volatile elements. Goldberg et al. (1975, 1976) studied F on the surfaces of green glass beads reporting up to 3000 ppm F on the surface and about 50 ppm in the interior. Jovanovic and Reed (1976) studied F, Cl, Br and I in leached and residue fractions of 15427 (but

did not notice anything unusual). Gibson and Andrawes (1978) reported 330 ppm S for 15427.

Recently, precise determination of highly-siderophileelement (HSE) concentrations (as etchates and residues) was reported by Walker et al. (2004) for green glass spheres from 15426 and 15421 (figure 13 and table 6). The comparatively high HSE concentrations and generally chondritic relative abundances of the etchates of 15426 suggest that the HSE in this aliquant of green glass were likely dominated by meteoritic contamination. The extremely low HSE (especially Os) in the residue is evidence that the deep interior of the moon is extremely depleted in HSE (20 times less than the terrestrial mantle).

Tatsumoto et al. (1987) did not find high 204Pb in the green glass (as was the case for the Apollo 17 orange glass). However, Barnes et al. (1973) and Silver (1973) reported excess, unsupported Pb.

# **Chemistry**

Bulk analyses of green glass samples are given in table 1 and figure 12. The green glass is very high in Mg (MgO = ~18%) and low in trace elements (U = 50 ppb) and the REE pattern is flat. The slightly elevated REE contents of the bulk samples is due to the addition of a small amount of lunar regolith.

The analyses of green glass spheres by Steele et al. (1992) are the most recent, and most comprehensive (table 2). They generally confirm the chemical groupings found by Delano (1979) and Galbreath et

al. (1990) (figure 6). Originally, Warner et al. (1972), Ridley et al. (1983) and others argued that the green glass was rather constant in composition. However, Stolper (1974), Wood and Ryder (1977) and others, explained minor variations as due to olivine separation. But the story is more complicated and apparently related to variations in deep lunar interior (Grove 1981). Although, Delano (1979) found 5 distinct groupings, in two trends (figure 7), Steele et al. (1992) show that most of the compositional characteristics of the green glasses can be explained by a model for batch equilibrium melting of a nearly homogeneous, ultramafic source region, when the complicating effects of high pressure and low oxygen fugacity are taken into account.

Schonfeld (1975) and Korotev (1987) used green glass as one of the components in their chemical mixing models for Apollo 15 soils.

Carbon and carbon compounds released by heating green glass samples have been studied by DesMarais et al. (1973), Modzeleski et al. (1972), Wszolek et al. (1972) and Simoneit et al. (1973). Simoneit et al. (1973) reported low temperature release of NO from 15426.

Walker et al. (2004) have most recently studied the highly-siderophile-element composition. They found that the "etchate" of the surfaces of the green glass contained substantially more Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt and Pd than the residue (figure 13, table 6). Their preferred interpretation was that this is from chondritic meteorite contamination on the surface of these glass beads. The lack of these elements in the residual glass, indicates that the lunar mantle is significantly lacking of these elements (yet there is Ni).

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Huneke et al. (1973) and Podosek and Huenke (1973) determined the 39Ar/40Ar age of 30 mg of green glass carefully separated by Lakatos et al. (1973) (figure 18). Their age (3.38 ± 0.06 b.y.) is significantly younger

In addition, Spangler et al. (1984) determined 3.62 ± 0.07 b.y. for yellow volcanic glass in 15426-7. Spangler and Delano (1984) also determined 3.35 ± 0.05 b.y. for the *yellow impact* glass mixed in the green glass clods. Finally, Huneke et al. (1974) reported an age of

## Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

Results of radiation counting of 125.7 grams of 15426 <sup>26</sup>Al (59 dpm/kg), <sup>22</sup>Na (38 dpm/kg) are reported in LSPET 1972.

Huneke et al. (1973) reported the exposure age as 300 m.y. and Spangler et al. (1984) determined exposure ages between 300 and 275 m.y. Lakatos et al. (1973) carefully determined the He, Ne and Ar in green glass beads separated from 15426.

Fleischer and Hart (1973) determined a track exposure age of 0.5 m.y. for the green glass in 15427.

## **Processing**

Obviously, each sample bag or container that held these friable breccias was found to contain numerous glass beads in the residue. This has been the source of many of the glass beads studied.

The rake sample collected at Spur Crater (15310 to 15392) also contained a few green glass clods – listed in table (Bunch et al. 1972, Cameron et al. 1972, Carusi et al. 1972, Cavaretta et al. 1972, Dowty et al. 1972, Ryder 1972, Ryder and Sherman 1989, Steele et al. 1972).
