# **Introduction**

15014 was collected from bottom of the Soil Mechanics Trench (figure 1) near the ALSEP site (station 8). Sample 15030 was also collected from the bottom of the trench, while 15040 was from the surface. This trench was deep enough (30 cm) for the samples from the bottom to be about -10 to -20 deg C before they were disturbed (see Keihm et al. 1973).

The Apollo 15 deep drill core was collected only 10 meters away – and should contain similar material with depth, because there are few craters in the vicinity (Swann et al. 1971, 1972).

15014 was placed in a special environmental sample container (SESC) which has remained unopened to date (2010).

*Observation: The unsieved reserve sample 15030 (75 g) should be studied before one attempts to study 15014.*

# **Petrography**

Should be the same as that of 15030.

# **Chemistry**

Should be the same as that of 15030.

# **Processing**

There was a mistake in the early documentation (Swann et al. 1971, 1972) related to the numbering of SESC containers 15014 (trench bottom, station 8) and 15013 (collected under LM). In the early documentation, these sample numbers were switched, but this mistake was corrected by the time of allocations for 15013.

SESC 15014, along with 15012, were returned in SCB 5 in ALSRC#2 (which leaked nitrogen). 15012 was found to be sealed (Simoneit et al. 1972), while 15014 remains unstudied (presumably still sealed). 15013 was returned in SCB 7 without the extra protection of the ALSRC (Butler 1972).

The seal was made of In(Ag) which was protected by Teflon rings (figure 2). Since the sample has not been opened, the weight of the sample is approximate.
