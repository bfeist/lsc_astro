#### **Introduction**

This is probably the material from the "pedestal" that 15415 was perched on (figure 1). After 15415 was picked off the top, the pedestal was broken up and several pieces collected from the soil (figure 2). It was returned in the same bag as 15430 – 15437. This sample has not been studied.

#### **Petrography**

Ryder (1985) says that 15435 was made of 32 friable "regolith clods". The inventory shows two large clods and several smaller. Numerous thin section were made of one of the clods (,7). The thin sections show it to be a glass matrix breccia (figure 3). Wilshire and Brett (in Butler 1972) described thin section 15435,34 as a swirl of "banded glass, debris-laden glass and intersertal basalt". Ryder (1985) reported that the multicolored glass bands are green, light brown, orange, colorless, and red-brown. However, a description of ,7 may not be representative of the main clods. The data pack shows that many of the other clods in this sample are very friable, and have partially "disintegrated" into fines.

Some of the coarse-fines from 15432 – 15434 (which?) must also be pieces of the "pedestal (see section on 15431".
