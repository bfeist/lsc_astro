# **Introduction**

The Apollo 15 deep drill (15001 – 15006) was taken at the ALSEP site – about 120 meters from the LM. There were no small craters in the vicinity (figure 1). The regolith is on top of a mare surface, but the highlands are only about 5 – 10 km away. The combined weight of the core was 1333 grams, and it was found to contain materials from both the mare and the highlands.

Trench soils 15030, 15040 and 15014 were collected about 10 meters away, and are better analyzed. 15030 and 15014 from the bottom of the trench (depth about 30 cm) might be comparable to material from 15005, which 15040 should be compared with 15006. Premission, it was expected that the deep drill might obtain material from the apparent rays from Autolycus and/ or Aristillus as well as detritus from the degradation of the Apennine Front.

This was the first use of the rotary-percussion drilling mechanism, but it obtained a core 2.42 meters long (2.04 cm diameter). However, it was very difficult to extract from its hole. Also segments 15001, 15002 and 15003 would not separate on the Moon, so they were brought back as one long segment and broken down in the LRL.

The main result of this core is that it has remained in place, slowing cooking in neutrons, for about half a billion years. The bottom of the core could not have been deposited more than 750 m.y. ago nor less than 420 m.y. ago (Curtis and Wasserburg 1977). That being said, it is also clear that the top of the core has become mature due to micrometeorite bombardment, because of the abundance of agglutinate particles. However, cosmic ray track studies, solar wind implanted rare gasses and other studies indicate that core material had previous exposure to solar wind and cosmic rays, and the record that can be read from this core still requires more work and interpretation.

*Figure 2: Maturity as function of depth in Apollo 15 deep drill core as determined by percentage agglutinate and Is/FeO (from Heiken et al. 1976). Maturity data is tabulated in Morris (1976). Note that the top of the core is very mature, while the bottom is very immature.* 

This core was found to have significant Pb contamination (Silver 1972). There is also a concern that the ends of the core segments were exposed to moisture.

# **Petrography**

Heiken et al. (1973, 1976) give a complete modal analysis of 34 samples along the length of the Apollo 15 deep drill. They found that the agglutinate content varied from 65% at the top to about 6 % at depth. This was found to be consistent with the maturity index Is/ FeO (figure 2). If you ignore the agglutinates and reaverage their mode you get the percentages of rock types in table B. Morris (1976) gives the magnetic maturity data and Morris (1978) discusses the evidence for gardening at the top of the deep drill core.

Walker and Papike (1981) and Papike et al. (1982) studied the thin sections prepared from 15003 and found that the deep drill was enriched in highlands materials relative to drive tube 15011 – 15010.

Basu and Bower (1976, 1977) studied fragments of KREEP basalt and determined the overall provenance of the materials in the Apollo 15 deep drill core. They concluded that the core has highland and mare materials in a ratio approximately 60:40, that the mare component generally increases from bottom to top in the core, quartz-normative basalts are nearly twice as abundant as olivine basalts, there were multiple sources of highland material, the highland component is similar to the highland regolith, KREEP basalt flow units were from depth, excavated and delivered as rays and that the green glass may be of impact origin.

Drake (1974) produced a catalog of the rock particles extracted from this core during dissection. Lindstrom et al. (1977) studied the mineralogy and chemistry of some of these particles.

Modal analysis was performed by Heiken et al. (1973 and 1975), and in detail for thin sections of 15003, by Walker and Papike (1981). These are summarized in

## **Chemistry**

While there is a lot of other data on this core, the chemical composition as function of depth is sparce, and one needs to look at the composition of the nearby trench samples, 15030 and 15040. Helmke et al. (1973) and Gold et al. (1977) appear to be the only ones who reported complete analyses of the deep drill. Wiesmann and Hubbard (1975) tabulated a few elements from the bottom of each segment and have reported a somewhat complete analysis of the bottom of the drill (table 1). Chou and Pearce (1979) determined the composition of different grain sizes. Reed and Jovanovic (1972) determined Ru, Os, Hg and U.

Gold et al. (1977) noted that there was a distinct difference in chemical composition between 15003 and 15001 (figure 3 and 4). Evensen et al. (1974) tried to

characterize the exotic component by analyzing size fractions (see table 2). Wszolek et al. (1973) and Wszolek and Burlingame (1973) determined the carbon chemistry of the deep drill core (figure 5).

Ma et al. (1976) and Lindstrom et al. (1977) analyzed some of the particles extracted from the core (some in table 4, figure 7).

## Radiogenic age dating

Pepin et al. (1974) reported the K-Ar age of soils from the core (3 b.y) - but that's not the age of the core!

### Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

Russ et al. (1972) and Pepin et al. (1974) showed that cosmic ray produced spallation nuclides are all smooth functions of depth. This indicates that the depositional history of the drill core is coherent and relatively simple.

Hubner et al. (1973), Bogard et al. (1973) and Bogard and Hirsch (1975) found that solar wind components were present throughout the length of the core. Bogard showed that <sup>4</sup>He and <sup>4</sup>He/<sup>3</sup>He were relatively constant.

Russ et al. (1972) and Curtis and Wasserburg (1977) determined the isotopic composition of soils and fresh particles along the length of the core and found substantial variation (figure 8, 9 and 10). They were able to model the neutron fluence that produced these variations and concluded that the bottom of the core "could not have been deposited more then 750 m.y. ago, nor less than 420 my. ago".

# **Other Studies**

Lindsay (1973), Heiken et al. (1973, 1976) and Graf (1993) reported detailed grain size data along the length of the A15 deep drill core. Morris (1976) tabulates the maturity index and Morris (1977) studied the variation with grain size (figure 13).

Smith et al. (1973) and Becker and Clayton (1977) found that nitrogen from the solar wind was considerably lighter in the past using the Apollo 15 deep drill samples.

Phakey et al. (1972), Crozaz et al. (1972), Bhandari et al. (1972, 1973), Fleischer et al. (1973, 1974) and Goswami and Lal (1977) determined the density of cosmic ray induced nuclear tracks in mineral grains as a function of depth in the A15 drill core (figure 14). Goswami and Lal (1977) claimed that the data indicated cyclic variation with an apparent periodicity of ~ 200- 300 m.y.

Lindsay and Srnka (1975) reported evidence for periodic fluctuation in the micrometeorite bombardment of the moon based on detailed petrography of samples from 120 to 240 cm depth in the A15 drill core. They even proposed that this was because the earth-moon system passed thru dense interstellar clouds at the time of deposition of this core!

These imaginative studies need verification.

# **Processing**

The three deepest segments of the deep drill (15001, 15002 and 15003) would not separate on the Moon and had to be brought back in a bag linked together (Duke and Nagle 1974). *"The ends were plugged on the lunar surface and tapped in the LM. The exteriors of the linked core sections were exposed to atmospheres of the LM and CM cabins and had water spots on them (probably caused by sea water splashing into the cabin through an open door after splashdown). The remaining sections were protected by the nylon bag, but the exteriors were exposed to the air in the cabin."*

Early allocations were made from the junctions of the core segments (3.75 g each) and portions of this soil was used for biomedical experiments. Other portions were used for initial allocations. The segments were then mounted in a cradle and split lengthwise with a milling machine (Heiken et al. 1972). Then the segments were transferred to another cabinet, the split core top removed, and the sample dissected into 5 mm intervals along the length down to approximately twothirds tube diameter. For thermoluminescence studies,

*Figure 11: 22Na and 26Al profiles in 15006 showing disturbance at top of Apollo 15 drill (Fruchter et al. 1977).* 

representative samples for each stratigraphic unit were collected under "red dark-room light". After dissection, the remaining third of the core was removed to a laminar flow bench where it was impregnated with nbutly methacrylate to make "peels". The peels were intended to maintain grain orientation and permanent stratigraphic record.

15003 is the only segment that was encapsulated in epoxy and for which a continuous set of thin sections were prepared.

According to Allton and Waltz (1977) *"the Apollo 15 drill core was completely filled and its scale is straightforward and accurately represents in situ lunar conditions*."

Silver (1972) found extensive Pb contamination from the joints in the deep drill.
