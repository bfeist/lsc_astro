## **Introduction**

15358 was collected by rake from the rim of Spur Crater (station 7). It is a glass-matrix breccia that contains clasts of KREEP basalt – see section on 15382.

## **Petrography**

Dowty et al. (1973) give the following brief description: "15358 contains clasts of a feldspar-rich, recrystallized rock, in a glassy matrix (figure 2). Matrix has TS recrystallized in places to a feathery texture. One large (3 mm) clast is rounded, has KREEP chemistry, and consists of small laths of feldspar and pyroxene and interstitial orange glass".

## **Processing**

There are 4 thin section and a bunch of small pieces of 15358. I don't think it has been analyzed.
