#### **Introduction**

15507 is made up of three glass particles that fit together as a hollow egg. It has not been subdivided nor studied. This sample was collected and returned with 15505 from a site near Hadley Rille – see section on 15501.

## **Petrography**

There is a zap pit on the interior wall of the large vesicle, proving that it was already broken on the lunar surface (Ryder 1985).

*Note: the transcript mentions that the astronauts were also trying to pick up a glass ball, but that they dropped it?*
