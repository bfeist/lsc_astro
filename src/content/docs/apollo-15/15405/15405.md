#### Transcript

LMP - - let me hold that Rover (figure 2) and you come up and look at this, because this rock has got green in it, a light green color. Come on. The first green rock I've seen – light green.

CC Dave and Jim, use your best judgment here, the block's not all that important -

CDR No, we're okay. It's just that this slope's pretty steep (15 deg), and I cannot take too much time – here. It's a big breccia – that's all it is.

LMP About halfway up, maybe you have to look down-sun to see it. It looks like a light green layer, not necessarily a thick layer. Light green.

CDR You mean on the surface?

LMP Yes, on the surface.

CDR Hey, you're right. ——

LMP This rock is about 3 meters long. Subangular – very rough surface. And the surface that's facing northwest is the dark, typical breccias. And it looks like –what appeared to me like there's a layer that might be a foot and a half thick, appears a light greenish color. Dave's sampling right now. And on the side to the southeast is again the breccia isn't that right Dave?

CDR Yes, and I got a little fragment. Don't drop it. There. And I got some green, and I got a fragment out of the breccia. It's fairly loose breccias, as breccias go. Oh, and there's a great big white clast on the inside, but – man , like an inch or so (bag 168). And I think we'll call it quits on that one.

#### **Introduction**

15405 was chipped from a prominent boulder (3 meter) at station 6A on the Apennine Front (figures 1 and 2). Station 6A was the highest point reached on the Apennine Front (about 100 meters above the level of the LM). The astronauts described the boulder as a "big breccia" and remarked on abundant green material (see transcript). They sampled a portion of the boulder (15405) and collected a soil sample from the top of the boulder (15401).

Swann et al. (1972) remark that *"although the boulder lies 250 meters from Spur Crater, it closely resembles samples 15445 and 15455, which were collected at Spur Crater, and the greenish-gray soils resemble friable, green rocks and green soils collected at Spur Crater. Hence, it is possible that the boulder was ejected from Spur Crater, or at least that it was derived from the same type of material that was excavated by the Spur Crater event."* The boulder has a deep fillet on the South, uphill side.

Marvin (1976) describes sample 15405 as a "rough and angular, welded mass of small, blocky slablets". It was returned broken into several fragments (figure 3), but the main mass was found to be tough and required sawing to obtain interior pieces (figure 4 and 5).

15405 was first studied by a consortium led by Rama Murthy, then by the "Imbrium Consortium" (led by Wood and Marvin). Early work is nicely summarized by Graham Ryder (1985), but a complete description of 15405 remains unpublished. Zircons from this sample have been found to be old, but the age of the breccia-forming event is young (~1.3 b.y.?).

Both 15405 and 15205 are both KREEP-rich breccias chipped from two different boulders on the lower slope of the Apennine Front.

#### **Petrography**

15405 is a clast-bearing impact-melt rock with a crystalline matrix made up of fine-grained intergrown

pyroxene, plagioclase and ilmenite laths (figure 6). Prominent clasts include mineral fragments of plagioclase and pyroxene (figure 7), along with lithic clasts of KREEP basalt, granite and quartz monzodiorite (QMD). Flow banding in the matrix includes small irregularly-shaped vugs (figure 5).

The clast population of 15405 generally lacks fragments of mare basalt, glass, anorthosite, norite or troctolite, but is instead rich in KREEP basalt. Warren (1993) lists four apparently pristine clasts from 15405 that have been studied (two alkaline suite and two KREEP-like).

The KREEP basalt clasts are described by Ryder and Bower (1976) and Ryder (1976). They have finegrained subophitic texture (figure 8) with about equal amounts of plagioclase and zoned pyroxene (figure 9) and were found to be similar to Apollo 15 KREEP basalts (see section on 15382). *No large clasts of KREEP basalt were found or studied from 15405.* 

Three large clasts of quartz monzodiorite (QMD) were analyzed and described Ryder (1976), Taylor et al. (1980) and Takeda et al. (1981). QMD clast A was large (~1 cm; 2.5 grams) and coarse-grained (figure 10) and includes subsamples ,56 ,57 ,85 etc. QMD clast B was extracted from slab ,95 (figure 19) and includes subsamples ,110 ,115 . 15405,145 is a thin section with a small portion of QMD clast B (figure 14). Taylor et al. (1980) estimate the mineral mode of QMD as 35% each of plagioclase and pyroxene, 10 15% each of silica and K-feldspar and 0.5 to 1% each of zircon, ilmenite, whitlockite and minor chromite and Fe metal. The pyroxene in 15405 QMD is Fe-rich and unzoned, but exsolved (figure 11). Takeda et al. (1981) studied pyroxene exsolution in QMD.

Granite clasts were reported, but it is unclear whether they are remelted QMD or not (Ryder 1976). McGee et al. (1978) describe granite clasts as coarse-grained (>1 mm) and typically crushed or melted. They consist of untwined plagioclase, clinopyroxene, cristobalite (?), and K-feldspar. Ilmenite, Fe-metal, troilite, chromite

and phosphate are present in minor amounts. No large clasts of "granite" were found or studied from 15405.

Clast ,170 (chipped from ,0) is a feldspathic alkali norite with plutonic texture and very high trace element content studied by Lindstrom et al. (1988) and Marvin

Clast ,181 (chipped from ,0) is a cataclastic alkali anorthosite studied by Lindstrom et al. (1988). It is

mostly granulated plagioclase (An84; 0.6 mm), with minor ilmenite and rare phosphate, but contains no pyroxene (see figure 16).

Ryder and Bower (1976) also briefly describe small clasts of "olivine vitrophyre" in thin section descriptions.

The close association of QMD and KREEP basalts in this breccia, along with similar REE patterns, led Ryder

(1976) to suggest there might be a "close association" of QMD with KREEP basalt. But we now know the ages of KREEP basalt are about 3.9 b.y, while the initial age of the QMD was about 4.3 b.y. Thus, this "association" is unlikely. Rutherford et al. (1976) discuss silicate liquid immiscibility as a process leading to QMD, but Ryder (1976) and Taylor et al. (1980) found the chemical evidence against an origin by liquid immiscibility.

#### **Chemistry**

The bulk composition of the matrix is similar to that of KREEP basalt (table 1 and figure 16). The composition of individual clasts in 15405 is given in table 2 and figure 14. The high REE content of the norite clast is due to a large whitockite grain and probably not representative. A number of clasts are pristine (Ir < 0.1 ppb) and even the matrix is relatively low in meteoritic siderophiles.

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

Bernatowicz et al. (1978) used the 39/40 Ar plateau age method to attempt to date the matrix and the QMD clast (figure 18). Nyquist et al. (1977) attempted to date QMD by Rb/Sr and found that the Sr was highly radiogenic, but could not obtain a well defined age. Tatsumoto and Unruh (1976) used U/Pb techniques, but found that the Pb was disturbed and could not obtain an age. Finally, Meyer et al. (1996) used the ion microprobe U/Pb technique to date zircons intergrown with other phases *insitu* in thin sections of QMD clasts A and B (figure 17).

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Drozd et al. (1976) determined an exposure age of 11 ± 1.1 m.y. by 81Kr and 6 m.y. by 21Ne.

### **Other Studies**

Rare gas studies are reported in Drozd et al. (1976).

Fleischer and Hart (1972, 1973) and Podosek and Walker (1976) measure fission track density and U in the matrix.

#### **Processing**

Initially several large pieces (,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8) broke off of the rock (see flow diagram). Sample 15405,5 was allocated for consortium study led by Rama Murthy and was analyzed by Laul and Schmitt (1972,1973). The main piece, termed 15405,0, was sawn in 1975 to create a slab, which broke in two main pieces (,95 and

,92). One butt end (, 91) is in remote storage. Processing of the rock was documented by the Imbrium Consortium, led by John Wood and Ursula Marvin, in their 1976 and 1977 reports. Graham Ryder consolidated all this information in his 1985 catalog, which represent the only decent published account (to date) of this complex sample.

There are 37 thin sections of 15405.
