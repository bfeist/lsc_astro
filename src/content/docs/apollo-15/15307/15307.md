This glass bead is from the surface at station 7 near Spur Crater where soil sample 15301 was collected.

The Apollo 15 catalog states: "15307 is a fragile, hollow glass sphere, with a lip. It is dark green/black. Its surface is smooth with very few zap pits. One side is shiny; the other dusty. The sample is broken slightly, revealing its hollowness, and at least where it is broken the walls are thin. It has never been processed or allocated. It was observed by the astronauts on the lunar surface and put in the container with soil".

The transcript makes interesting reading.

*LMP "Keep an eye on the spherule."*

*CRD "My little paw. So, I'll get you a bag; let me take a picture of that. I'll get a bag; then you can get the soil."*

*LMP "Where are you going to put that little spherule?"*

*CDR "In the bag."*

*LMP "Not with the soil, though, are you?"*

*CDR "Yes. Came out of the soil. I just didn't want to miss it. - - - Little fat ball. - - - Let's fill the bag. - -*
