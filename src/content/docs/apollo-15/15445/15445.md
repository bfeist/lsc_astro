## **Introduction**

Lunar sample 15445 is a recrystallized impact melt breccia containing several (~10) individual white clasts, the largest being a shocked norite (clast B) dated at ~ 4.28 - 4.46 b.y . Other white clasts in 15445 contain blood-red spinel and have very high (mafic) Mg/Fe ratios (clast A, G etc. ). 15445 is found to be an assemblage of magnesian plutonic and metamorphic lithic clasts of deep-seated origin, embedded in a matrix of mineral fragments bonded by a melt phase. Clasts of surficial origin are absent. The melt phase has recrystallized as a fine-grained matrix of plagioclase, olivine and opaques.

15445 was found lying on the surface near a 1.5 x 0.6 m boulder with white clasts (figure 24) and is believed to have been broken off the boulder (Bailey and Ulrich 1975). This sample and its close companion (15455) are thought to be ejecta from the Imbrium Basin. Their exposure ages (~200 m.y.) may help date the age of Spur Crater where they were found.

Initially, Paul Gast and later, John Wood, acted as consortium chiefs for 15445 and there is careful documentation of 15445 by Ursula Marvin in the Imbrium Consortium booklet (vol. 1), by Ryder and Norman (1979) in "Pristine Non-mare Materials" and

by Ryder (1985) in the Apollo 15 catalog. Part of clast B of 15445 was included in the "Norite Consortium" led by Larry Nyquist (Shih et al. 1993). The rock has been substantially broken up (Ryder 1985), but careful detective work will lead to residual fragments that can be studied further.

## **Petrography**

Anderson (1973) and Ridley et al. (1973) initially described the mineralogy and chemical composition of the mafic clasts found in15445. Herzberg and Baker (1980) went on to calculate their depth of origin in the lunar crust from their mineral composition.

The largest clast in 15445 (clast B) is a cataclastic norite (figure 1) described below. Shih et al. (1993) were able to date the 15445 norite clast, but they obtained two different old ages (4.28 and 4.46 b.y.). Their interpretation is that the large norite clast may be composed of more than one old plutonic rocks, with distinctly different ages and initial isotope ratios.

Ryder and Bower (1977) studied the matrix of 15445 finding that it is "an aggregate of mineral clasts and minerals that crystallized at least partly from a silicate melt, as demonstrated in particular by the presence of euhedral, skeletal olivines" up to 100 microns in length. About 70% of the matrix is a fine-grained mass of interlocking anhedra of olivine and plagioclase (5-20 microns) with intergranular needles of ilmenite (figure 3). Metallic iron and Mg-Al spinel are minor, but ubiquitous, phases in the matrix and pyroxene is rare. In places there is as much as 10 % void space as vugs and vesicles (figures 2, 3 and 18). Ryder and Bower (1977) note the high meteoritic siderophile element content, similar to that of 15455, and typical of highland breccias. Thus they conclude that sample 15445 is a "fragment-laden impact melt". Ryder and Wood (1977) interpret these two breccias to be Imbrium ejecta.

McGee et al. (1979) reported that there were *"interfingering zones of matrix material and lithic clasts giving the sample an overall foliated appearance, the result of differences in mineralogical and chemical composition and porosity."* However, Engelhardt (1979) describes the 15445 matrix as granular, in a group "without any signs of a sequential order of crystallization" whose members are "granoblastic products of solid state recrystallization", i.e., metamorphic. But the individual mineral fragments within the matrix have only thin margins where they have interacted with the melt. Using the composition of the centers of the minerals, Spudis et al. (1991) found that most of the mineral fragments in the matrix were

derived from troctolites. Mineral fragments from norites, or ferroan anorthosite appear to be mysteriously absent.

## **Mineralogy**

Olivine: The olivine in the spinel troctolite clasts (A and G) has a very high Mg/Fe ratio (Fo<sub>95-80</sub>). Likewise, some of the individual olivine mineral clasts in the breccia matrix are also very mafic (Fo<sub>95-65</sub>) (figure 6). The small, euhedral olivine crystals in the breccia matrix are more Fe-rich and crystallized from the matrix. Steele and Smith (1975) found that trace elements (Ca, Ti, Cr, Ni and Al) in olivine from the spinel troctolite clast were extremely low, indicating that this clast formed in a plutonic environment with very slow cooling. Chromite is found as an inclusion in olivine.

**Pyroxene:** Orthopyroxene in the lithic clasts of 15445 is Mg-rich and augite has not been reported. Pyroxene is lacking as a mineral clast in the matrix, but finegrained orthopyroxene is intergrown with plagioclase in the recrystallized melt (Ridley et al. 1973).

**Plagioclase:** Plagioclase is calcic in the clasts and in the matrix (Ryder 1985, Spudis et al. 1991).

**Chromite:** Ryder and Bower (1977) find that rare chromite has a high Mg/Fe ratio.

Mg,Al spinel: This rock contains rock clasts with blood-red pleonate spinel. Spinel is also found as

mineral clasts in the breccia matrix. Table 5 gives the compositions reported.

*Armalcolite:* Armalcolite was reported in the ultramafic spinel troctolite clast studied by Anderson (1973).

#### **Significant Clasts**

#### *Clast A - Spinel Troctolite:* (Lith 45E)

Clast A is white with 5-8% red grains (Brett and Butler 1971). Material is very friable so that splits ,8 - ,11 consist of powder only. Split ,7 consists of the only large mineral grains obtained, some of which include matrix, and was made into a grain mount (,60 and ,92). Anderson (1973) studied split 15445,10, finding that it was "ultramafic." Ryder and Bower (1977) did not study clast A directly, but found similar material as small clasts in other thin sections.

#### *Clast B - Norite:* (Lith 45D)

Clast B is the largest clast in the rock and consists of white plagioclase with some green material (pyroxene). Splits ,38 and ,39 contain both black matrix and white clast material (figure 22). The pyroxene is orthopyroxene with high Mg/Fe ratio (figure 11) and plagioclase is very calcic (figure 2).

Shih et al. (1993) obtained two different Sm/Nd ages with different initial ratios for two different portions

of this large white clast (see below). They concluded "clast B" is "heterogeneous" and made up of more than one lithology. This has not been studied mineralogically. However, chemical analyses of clast B seem to be similar for different splits (table 2).

# *Clast E - Noritic Anorthosite:* ,175

Warren and Wasson (1978) reanalyzed clast E after Blanchard et al. (unpublished) reported it as an "anorthosite" and found higher trace element content (table 2 and figure 10). This could be due to admixed breccia matrix or the clast could be heterogenous. Ryder and Bower (1977) found that the thin sections (,139 and ,221) purportedly of this clast were quite different. The mafic composition of pyroxene in this clast place it in the field of troctolites (figure 7), rather than anorthosite (although it has abundant plagioclase).

(1976) of this clast are tabulated in table 2 and figure 10. Mineral compositions haven't been determined.

### *Clast H – Spinel Troctolite:*

Baker and Herzberg (1980) studied thin section 15445,177 of clast H. They found the clast exhibits evidence of extensive shock metamorphism, but were able to obtain mineral compositions: plagioclase  $An_{95}$ . olivine  $Fo_{91-93}$ , orthopyroxene  $Wo_1En_{91}Fs_8$  and spinel with Mg/Mg+Fe = 0.81-0.84 and Cr/Cr+Al = 0.07 – 0.11. Herzberg and Baker (1980) calculate a depth of origin of 12 to 32 kilometers for this mineral assemblage.

approximate position of clast D in some documentation. It was removed early (as ,2), because it was breaking free of matrix (as in a loose "tooth"). It has not been studied.

#### Chemistry

Tables 1 and 3 and figure 5 give the chemical composition of the matrix (analyses are in general agreement). The matrix is found to be similar to that of 15455, and Gros et al. (1976) conclude the matrix is the product of the Imbrium impact. Note that the matrix for 15445 and 15455 have characteristically high Mg/Fe ratios, compared to that of other melt rocks.

Table 2 summarizes the chemical composition of the clasts that have been studied to date. Ridley et al. (1973) reported a strange REE pattern for the spinel troctolite clast A that has not been verified (figure 10). The data for the norite clast B are consistent (figure 12) and similar to that of other lunar norites. Data for clast E are so different that one might assume that a sample was misnumbered.

## Radiogenic age dating

Bernstein (1983) were unable to obtain a flat plateau in stepwise Ar/Ar dating, but quote an age for the matrix of ~3.76 b.y. Shih et al. (1993) were able to date two different portions of the large norite clast, but they found two distinctly different ages 4.28 and 4.46 b.y. with two different initial Nd isotope ratios (figures 14 and 16), leading them to conclude that "clast B is heterogeneous and contains at least two similar lithologies" (but with different ages). Dating by Rb/Sr proved impossible due to Rb mobilization (figures 13 and 15).

Unruh and Tatsumoto (1976) (in Imbrium Consortium) reported U, Th and Pb analysis without obtaining age information (i.e. *Pb has been volatilized, mobilized and contaminated*).

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Keith et al. (1973) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 22Na = 45 dpm/kg., 26Al = 81 dpm/kg. and 46Sc = 0.8 dpm/kg. Bernstein (1983) apparently determined a 38Ar exposure age of 220 m.y. Drozd et al. (1977) determined 21Ne and 81Kr exposure ages of

## Transcript

CC Okay, Dave, while you're working there we're thinking that we'd prefer just a very quick sampling of the large rock, if at all. And perhaps just a quick photodocumentation of that large rock and then some rake samples.

CC Dave and Jim, the science input now is that we want to forget that large block entirely.

CDR I'll get the gnomon. And while you're putting the rake on I'll photograph this thing , anyway. I think it looks very much like the 14 rocks. Though, it looks maybe a little darker-gray. There's a convenient piece broken off, right here (15445).
