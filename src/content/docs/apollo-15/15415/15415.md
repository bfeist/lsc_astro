### **Transcript**

CDR Okay. Now let's go down and get that unusual one. Look at the little crater here, and the one that's facing us. There is this little white corner to the thing. What do you think the best way to sample it would be?

LMP I think probably – could we break off a piece of the clod underneath it? Or I guess you could probably lift that top fragment off.

CDR Yes. Let me try. Yes. Sure can. And it's a white clast, and it's about – *oh, boy!* 

LMP Look at the – glint. Almost see twinning in there.

CDR Guess what we found? Guess what we just found?

LMP I think we found what we came for.

CDR Crystal rock, huh? Yes, sir. You better believe it. Look at the plag in there. Almost all plag – as a matter of fact – *oh, boy*, I think we might – ourselves something close to anorthosite, because its crystalline and there's just a bunch – it's just almost all plag. What a beaut.

LMP That really is a beauty. And, there's another one down there.

CDR Yes. We'll get some of these. - - - No, let's don't mix them – let's make this a special one. I'll zip it up. Make this bag 196, a special bag. Our first one. Don't lose your bag now, Jim. *O, boy.* 

## *Transearth Coast* Press Conference

CC Q2: Near Spur Crater, you found what may be "Genesis Rock", the oldest yet collected on the Moon. Tell us more about it.

CDR Well, I think the one you're referring to was what we felt was almost entirely plagioclase or perhaps anorthosite. And it was a small fragment sitting on top of a dark brown larger fragment, almost like on a pedestal. And Jim and I were quite impressed with the fact that it was there, apparently waiting for us. And we hoped to find more of it, and, I'm sure, had we more time at that site, that we would have been able to find more. But I think this one rock, if it is, in fact, th beginning of the Moon, will tell us an awful lot. And we'll leave it up to the experts to analyze it when we get back, to determine its origin.

### **Introduction**

Lunar anorthosite 15415 was found perched on a clod of soil breccia (15435) on the rim of Spur Crater (Wilshire et al. 1972). Spur Crater is about 50 meters above the mare surface on the slope of Hadley Delta. It is subdued in nature and apparently old. The samples collected from Spur Crater had a range of exposure ages indicating that the material excavated may have been pre-exposed and/or may include material added from other sources after the Spur event (Arvidson et al. 1975).

During a transearth coast press conference, 15415 was called "Genesis Rock" and the name has stuck in spite of the fact that it may not be the oldest rock from the Moon. The astronauts correctly recognized that it was coarse-grained, made almost entirely of plagioclase and probably from the lunar highlands (figure 1). Thin sections also show that it is an anorthosite made almost entirely of coarse-grained plagioclase (figure 2) and that it is only mildly shocked. Age dating proved difficult, but an age of about 4 b.y. was determined by the Ar plateau method. However, the very low initial 87Sr/86Sr ratio attests to it great antiquity and the lack of meteoritical siderophiles proves its pristinity (lack of contamination by impacts).

In summary, 15415 is a unique lunar sample, in that, it is a pristine coarse-grained, unbrecciated anorthosite made up of mostly (98%) calcic plagioclase (An96). For a rock to have this much plagioclase, the rock must have formed by a process of plagioclase accumulation. It is generally understood that the original crust of the moon formed by plagioclase floatation from a magma ocean (see Warren 1985). But the exact connection of 15415 to this process is unclear, because Ar dating of 15415 showed it to be too young to have formed from the original lunar magma ocean.

Ryder (1985) provided a comprehensive review of all aspects of 15415. The section on 15435 provides a picture of the sample on the moon.

## **Petrography**

15415 is made up of 98% plagioclase, with minor pyroxene and trace ilmenite and silica (see mode). In some areas, the maximum grain size of plagioclase in 15415 is 1.8 cm (Wilshire 1972), or 3 cm (James 1972) with crystals grown together with smooth grain boundaries and trigonal intersections (typically a metamorphic texture). Stewart et al. (1972) coined the term Apollonian metamorphism to describe the texture of plagioclase and mineral assemblage of 15415.

Minor diopsidic augite (Ca-pyroxene) occurs as inclusions in plagioclase, polygons along grain boundaries and septa between large plagioclase grains. The pyroxene grains are small (~100 microns) and show exsolution of pigeonite and orthopyroxene. Discrete grains of orthopyroxene are also present. Evans et al. (1978) conclude from the structure of orthopyroxene that the last temperature of metamorphism was 500 to 600 deg. C.

15415 is classified as a ferroan anorthosite based on the calcic composition of the plagioclase and Fe-rich composition of the low-Ca pyroxene (figure 4). The mineralogical mode is difficult to determine because of the large grains size of the plagioclase.

Portions of 15415 have a cataclastic texture. Other portions exhibit mild shock causing offsets in the polysynthetic twinning in plagioclase (figure 2).

### **Mineralogy**

*Plagioclase:* The plagioclase in 15415 is unzoned and uniformly An96-97 (see table). It contains only minor amounts of FeO and MgO. Plagioclase in 15415 exhibits both albite and pericline twinning (figure 2). Papike et al. (1997) used the ion microprobe to analyze plagioclase for the REE (figure 5). Palme et al. (1984) carefully analyzed plagioclase mineral separates by INAA (table).

Stewart et al. (1972) and Czank et al. (1973) determined the crystal structure (P1) and found both short and long range cation ordering. Lally et al. (1972), Heuer et al. (1972) and Nord et al. (1973) used high voltage electron microscope techniques to study plagioclase in 15415.

*Pyroxene:* The composition of pyroxene in 15415 is given in figure 3. The bulk of the pyroxene in 15415 is diopsidic augite Wo46En39Fs16 (Hargraves and Hollister 1972), but thin lamellae and small patches of hypersthene analyze as Wo2.5En Evans et al. <sup>58</sup>Fs39.5. (1978) determined the crystal structure (Pbca) and unit cell size of orthopyroxene for 15415. Smith and Steele (1974) suggested that some of the pyroxene in 15415 might have formed by exsolution of FeO and MgO from plagioclase, reacting with silica at grain boundaries.

Hubbard et al. (1971), Wanke et al. (1975), Haskin et al. (1981) and Ganapathy et al. (1973) have analyzed **Radiogenic age dating** 

Radiogenic elements were determined in an attempt to about 0.5 b.y. after the formation of the moon". age date the rock (table 2).

15415 (table 1). The bulk rock composition is similar Tatsumoto et al. (1972), Nunes et al. (1972) and Tera to the plagioclase composition as determined by ion et al. (1972) determined U, Th and Pb isotopic data, probe (figure 5). Morgan et al. (1972) and Reed and but could not date the rock in this way. Tera et al. Jovanovic (1972) also report chemical data. (1972) found that the Pb isotopic composition of 15415 was evolved, such that it "represents the evolution of

## **Summary of Age Data for 15415**

|                      | Ar/Ar               |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| Husain et al. 1972   | 4.09 ± 0.19 b.y.    |
| Turner et al. 1972   | 4.05 ± 0.15         |
| Stettler et al. 1973 | 3.99 ± 0.06         |
|                      | 3.91 ± 0.1          |

15415 also proved impossible to data by Rb-Sr systematics. Whole rock Rb-Sr data were presented by Wasserburg and Papanastassiou (1971), Nyquist et al. (1972), Tatsumoto et al. (1972) and Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1973). These analysts determined that the 87Sr/86Sr ratio was extremely low.

**PS: This data not corrected with new decay constant.** 

The argon 39/40 technique proved more useful, although good thermal release plateaus were not achieved (figure 6 and 7). However, one must consider the apparent metamorphic texture of this rock in order to interpret the apparent Ar age (~4 b.y.), the low initial 87Sr/86Sr along with substantial He and Ar loss. Francis Albarede (1978) applied linear inversion techniques to recalculate the argon data of Turner et al. and discover the complex thermal history of 15415.

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Husain et al. (1972), Turner (1972) and Stettler et al. (1973) determined 38Ar exposure ages of 90, 112 and 100 m.y. respectively for 15415. Eugster et al. (1984) determined 104 ± 15 m.y. by 81Kr and inferred a multistage exposure history. Eugster et al. determined that 15415 has lost about 90% of its He and 40% of its Ar.

Keith and Clark (1972) reported activities 116 ± 9 dpm/ kg for 26Al, 36 ± 5 dpm/kg for 22Na, 0.4 ± 0.9 dpm/kg for 54Mn, 3 ± 4 dpm/kg for 56Co.

### **Other Studies**

15415 has been the object of many studies (summarized in table, see also Ryder 1985).

Eugster et al. (1984) determined that the rare gas content and isotopic ratios of 15415. They reported that 15415 had experienced significant diffusion losses, because 98% of the 3 He and possibly 40% of the radiogenic 40Ar is apparently lost.

## **Processing**

List of Photo #s

15415 was originally (1972) subdivided by prying off one end (,34) and sawing off the other end (,33) (see diagram and figure 8). Sample 15415,33 was further subdivided by additional sawing. In 1975, 15415 was further subdivided to provide pieces (,139 and ,140) to go to remote storage (figure 9). Twenty-two thin sections were prepared from ,3 and from ,55.
