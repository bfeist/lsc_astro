## **Introduction**

15608 was collected by rake from the Terrace on the rim of Hadley Rille (see section on 15614). It is a basalt with unusual texture interpreted as the result of rapid cooling at the edge of a lava flow. Hey, guys, it deserves some study.

## **Petrography**

Ryder (1985) describes this particle as the chilled margin of a lava flow. It consists of numerous skeletal pigeonite mcirophenocrysts in a finer-grained variolitic groundmass of pyroxene, plagioclase and opaque minerals (figure 2 and 3). One edge of the particle is a beautiful example of "comb layering". Fine parallel crystals of pyroxene project towards the edge. Beautiful radial clusters have formed around nucleation centers

There are clusters of olivine crystals in the center.

## **Chemistry**

None reported

## **Processing**

There are three thin sections of this particle.
