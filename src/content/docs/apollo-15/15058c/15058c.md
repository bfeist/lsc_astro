# **Introduction**

15058 is a quartz-normative mare basalt with abundant elongate pyroxene crystals (figure 1). It has been dated at 3.4 b.y. with an exposure age of ~ 135 m.y.

15058 is one of the largest basalts returned from the moon, but its lunar orientation is not known with much certainty. The catalog records a few zap pits of the B1, W1and E1 surface, none on T1, N1 or S1. The sample has been shown to have a multistage exposure history (Eugster et al. 1984) and has been used for numerous studies of cosmic ray tracks.

# **Petrography**

Ryder (1985), Bence and Papike (1972), Brown et al. (1972) and Gay et al. (1972) and Juan et al. (1972) describe the texture of 15058 and classify it as a pigeonite basalt. Large phenocrysts of pigeonite are green in the cores with brown rims. Although Rhodes and Hubbard (1973) reported rare olivine, the rock is quartz-normative. Olivine is restricted to cores of large pigeonite. Clusters of radiating plagioclase crystals are common (figure 3). Vugs contain pyroxene and plagioclase with diktytaxitic texture.

Papike et al. (1972) note that exsolution features are consistent with "slow cooling". The cooling rate of 15058 and other basalts was studied experimentally by Grove and Walker (1977), Lofgren et al. (1975) and others.

# **Mineralogy**

*Pyroxene:* The pyroxenes in 15058 are long – up to 2 cm in length – and highly zoned. Bence and Papike (1972) reported analyses of pyroxene in 15058 (figure 5). Papike et al. (1976) reported the cell dimensions of pyroxene crystals. Burns et al. (1972) discussed the charge balance and color of transition elements. Papike et al. (1972) discuss pyroxene exsolution and note that the coes of large pigeonite are not exsolved.

*Plagioclase:* Hollow plagioclase laths can be seen in thin section (figure 2). Gay et al. (1972), Juan et al.

(1972) and Wenk et al. (1973) reported plagioclase composition An80-90.

*Ilmenite:* Taylor et al. (1972) have used Zr in ilmenite as a measure of cooling rate and Engelhardt (1979) has determined the paragenesis of the rock using shape of ilmenite.

*Spinel:* Haggerty (1972) found that the spinel in 15058 was limited to ulvospinel.

*Phosphates:* McCubbin et al. (2010) have found that most of the phosphate grains in 15058 are fluorapatite with minor chloroapatite and trace water (~2400 ± 1100 ppm H2 O).

# **Chemistry**

O'Kelley et al. (1972) reported the K, Th and U content of the whole sample. The bulk composition was determined by LSPET (1972), Willis et al. (1972), Fruchter et al. (1973), Helmke et al. (1973), Rhodes et al. (1973). Wolf et al. (1979) determined trace elements (table 1). The composition is like that of other Apollo 15 basalts (figures 7 and 8). Gibson et al. (1975) determined the sulfur content (960 ppm).

Gibson and Moore (1972) determined the thermal release, outgassing of H2 0, CO2 and other species (figure 12).

### Radiogenic age dating

Husain (1974) and Birck et al. (1975) determined the crystallization age of 15058 by Ar/Ar plateaus and Rb/Sr ischrons (figures 9 and 10).

#### Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

Eldridge et al. (1972) determined cosmic ray induced activity of  $^{22}$ Na = 26 dpm/kg,  $^{26}$ Al = 62 dpm/kg and  $^{54}$ Mn = 27 dpm/kg.

Eugster et al. (1984) were able to separate the solar cosmic ray effects at the surface from the galactic cosmic ray effects at depth in 15058. They found that 15058 must have had a multistage exposure history, because <sup>81</sup>Kr was found to significantly increase near the surface (figure 11) while <sup>83</sup>Kr are constant with depth. This would be explained by 15085 having

received most of its cosmic ray irradiation in a "shielded location" (beneath the regolith) and finally being exposed to solar irradiation for the last million years right at the lunar surface. Eugster et al. also found that <sup>81</sup>Kr, along with <sup>3</sup>H (tritium), was enhanced in the surface.

#### **Other Studies**

Sato (1973) determined the intrinsic oxygen fugacity of 15058. Epstein and Taylor (1972) determined the composition of oxygen, silicon isotopes of mineral separates.

# **Processing**

First a long slab was cut (figure 15), then a compound slab was cut at right angles by cutting slabs from each side piece (figure 16). A long thin column was cut from the center of the first slab (,32). This sample was much allocated, especially to science labs wishing to study "physical properties". There are 18 thin sections of 15058.

Several pieces of 15058 have been allocated for public display (figure 13). One is at the NASA AMES Research Center in California, a second at the NASA Kennedy Space Center in Florida, a third at the NASA Lewis Research Center and a fourth is held at JSC PAO.

Additional detailed information is found in the catalog by Ryder (1985).
