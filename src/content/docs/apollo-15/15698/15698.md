## **Introduction**

This glass object was separated from the rake fines in 1975. It may be a glass covered "bomb" with a lithic fragment inside (Ryder 1985). It has not been studied.

## **Petrography**

15698 is a round, dark gray, tough, smooth glass object (figures 1 and 2). No micrometeorite craters are present, but small vugs are present. In one place an interior piece of white material is present and the adjacent thin glass coating is brown in color. Ryder (1985) suggests that there may be a lithic clast inside. So far, it has not been allocated. The sample is about 1.5 cm in diameter.
