**15515**  Regolith Breccia 145 grams

*Figure 1: Photo of 15515. Cubes are 2 inches. S72-16701* 

# **Introduction**

15515 was collected as a pair of large soil clods - see section on 15511. The area where they were picked up was relatively near Hadley Rille. They broke into many pieces and some soil. They contains a high percentage of mare material.

# **Petrography**

15515 is brown, very friable, porus and full of glass particles. The modal mineralogy was reported in the original Apollo 15 catalog and repeated by Ryder (1985). It should be the same as 15511.

*Note: the classic studies of Apollo 15 regolith breccias by McKay et al. (1989) and Simon et al. (1986) did not include 15515.* 

# **Chemistry**

Jovanovic and Reed (1975) determined Cl, Br, I, U and P. Reed et al. (1977) determined Pb, Zn Bi and Tl. Laul and Schmitt (1973) and Wanke et al. (1977) determined the other elements (table). *An analysis of the soil collected with this sample is included for comparison. It should be noted that soils are sieved, while breccias are not. Breccias are the own best container and a chip of a breccia may be less contaminated for some elements.* 

# **Other Studies**

Silver (1972) reported the isotopic composition of Pb.

# **Processing**

15515 was returned as several pieces in the bag with 15511. There are 16 thin sections of 15515.
