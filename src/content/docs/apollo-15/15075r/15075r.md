### **Introduction**

15075 was one of several basalt samples collected as a radial sample near the rim of Elbow Crater (15065 – **Mineralogical Mode for 15075** 15085). They all appear to be similar (Ryder 1985) . **Sample Catalog Taylor and** 15077 is interpreted as a "sister" sample to 15076. **Butler 1971 Misra 1975** 

15075 is a coarse-grained porphyritic pigeonite basalt Pyroxene 45 ~45 with subophitic matrix (figures 2 a,b). It has been dated Plagioclase 50 ~45 Opaques 1 at 3.4 b.y. and has been exposed on the lunar surface Pyroxferroite 2-5 for 265 m.y. (age of Elbow Crater ?). Silica 3-5

# **Petrography**

Taylor and Misra (1975) and Ryder (1985) described 15075. It is apparently another piece of 15076 (which is well studied). Pryoxenes and plagioclase compose 90% of the rock; accessories include chromiteulvospinel, pyroxferroite, cristobalite, tridymite, ilmenite, Fe-Ni metal, and fayalite. The pyroxenes are highly zoned (figure 2b, 3) and up to 6 mm long. The mesostasis includes complex intergrowths of fayalite + Ca-rich pyroxene + silica which may be "breakdown products" of pyroxferroite (Ryder 1985).

Lofgren et al. (1975) concluded that 15075 had a cooling rate of about 1 deg C per day. The lunar orientation of 15075 is known from surface photography, but it has not been used for solar, cosmic ray studies.

# **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* none

*Pyroxene:* Large pigeonite grains up to 6 mm in length are chemically zoned (figure 2, 3 and 4). Taylor and Misra (1975) tabulate pyroxene analyses, including pyroxferroite.

*Plagioclase:* Taylor and Misra (1975) analyzed plagioclase (figure 5).

*Chormite:* There is complete zoning from chromite to ulovspinel (Taylor and Misra 1975).

*Metal:* Taylor and Misra (1975) and Taylor et al. (1975 ) found high Co in Ni-rich iron grains (figure 6).

### **Chemistry**

The bulk chemical composition of 15075 has not been determined, probably because sister sample 15076 has been well analyzed. The K2 O content of 15075 was reported by Schaeffer and Schaeffer (1977) as 0.037 % or 0.051 %, while CaO was found to be 16.8 or 15.9 % (too high). Cripe and Moore (1975) measured 390 ppm S.

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Schaeffer and Schaeffer (1977) dated 15075 by the Ar/ Ar plateau technique as 3.45 ± 0.2 b.y.

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Schaeffer and Schaeffer (1977) determined two exposure ages (274 and 258 m.y.) for 15075.

### **Other Studies**

Simmons et al. (1975) studied microcracks in 15075.

### **Processing**

In 1973, a slab was cut through the middle of 15075 (figure 8). Pieces of 15075 are used for public displays at the Ontario Science Center, Canada and the NASA AMES Research Center, California (figure 9).

There are 15 thin sections.
