## **Introduction**

Lunar breccias 15288 and 15289 were collected from the rim of a small crater at station 6 on the Apennine Front – along with 15265 and 15285-6. All of these samples are similar regolith breccias. They are relatively coherent with glass-cemented matrix.

## **Petrography**

15288 and 15289 are described as tough, glassy, regolith breccias by Ryder (1985). They have abundant glass particles, beads and devitrified glass objects cemented by a glass matrix Ifigure 3 and 4).

*Note: the classic studies of Apollo 15 regolith breccias by McKay et al. (1989) and Simon et al. (1986) did not include 15288-289.* 

## **Chemistry**

Wanke et al. (1978) provided an analysis of 15288.

## **Processing**

15288 and 15289 were returned in the same bag as 15285 and 15287. There are three thin sections of each breccia.
