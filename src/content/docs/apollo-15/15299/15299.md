#### Introduction

15299 was found laying on top of the regolith at station 6, which was about 100 meters up the north slope of Hadley Delta. The bulk sample is brownish, with small white clasts (figure 1). It is a coherent soil breccia with inclusions of glass found in the regolith (McKay et al. 1989). Fractures have slickensides.

Simon et al. (1986) studied soil breccias from Apollo 15 and argued that some of them represent ancient lunar soils. However, 15299 is very like A15 soil. The Apollo 15 catalog by Ryder (1985) contains additional information.

#### **Petrography**

15299 is a brown glass matrix breccia that is made up of compressed and welded soil components similar to the local soil (figure 2). Juan et al. (1972) describe

15299 as: 12% lithic fragments (mare basalt, micrograbbro, anorthosite and pre-existing breccia), 11% mineral fragments (bytownite, clionopyroxene, orthopyroxene, olivine, spinel and opaques), 3% glass fragments, 4% glass spheres set in 70% glassy matrix (<0.1 mm).

McKay and Wentworth (1983) reported that 15299 was compact, with low fracture porosity, minor shock features, rare agglutinates and minor class spheres. Wentworth and McKay (1984) determined the bulk density of 15299 as 2.49 g/cm³ (relatively compact). McKay et al. (1984) determined the maturity index (I<sub>s</sub>/FeO) between 22-34 (submature) (see also summary in McKay et al. 1989).

Warren et al. (1987) studied the texture, mineralogy and composition of two basalt clasts from 15299 (figure 3) and found them similar in detail with some other

Apollo 15 mare basalts (see their paper for detail). Split ,196 is the clast pictured in figure 3. Split ,201 is from a chip that fell off the sample.

# **Significant Clasts**

*Mare basalt ,74 ,197TS* 

This is probably the coarse grained basalt clast pictured in figure 3 (and ,196 in Warren).

## **Chemistry**

Wanke et al. (1973), Taylor et al. (1973), Korotev (in McKay et al. 1989) and others give analysis of matrix of 15299, which is found to have a composition similar to the bulk soil at station 6 (table 1). Taylor et al. calculated that 15299 was a mixture of 15.8% "highland basalt" and 84.2% "low-K Fra Mauro". Warren et al. (1987) analyzed two basalt clasts (figure 4). Kothari and Goel (1973) determined 74 ± 4 ppm nitrogen and Filleau et al. (1978) reported 30-42 ppm carbon (the relatively low C content is at odds with high C in other A15 brown glass matrix breccias).

## **Other Studies**

The rare gas content and isotopic composition of 15299 were determined by Bogard and reported in McKay et al. (1989). The carbon content has been studied by Filleux et al. (1978), hydrogen by Merlivat et al. (1974), and nitrogen by Kothari and Goel (1973).

Silver (1973a) determined the U-Th-Pb systematics of 15299 and found them similar to that of the Apollo 15 soils.

## **Processing**

Piece ,1 was sawn to produce a small slab (,3) for alloctions (figure 7). Large piece ,0 was also sawn (1975) to produce two large pieces ,0 and ,161 (figure 5). There are 47 thin sections. 15299 is one of the rocks included in the Lunar Educational Thin Section Set (Meyer 1987).
