#### **Introduction**

Lunar sample 15555 (called "Great Scott", after the collector Dave Scott) is one of the largest samples returned from the moon and is representative of the basaltic samples found on the mare surface at Apollo 15. It contains olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts and is olivine normative in composition (Rhodes and Hubbard 1973, Ryder and Shuraytz 2001). The bulk composition of 15555 is thought to represent that of a

primitive volcanic liquid and has been used for various experimental studies related to the origin of lunar basalts (e.g. Walker et al. 1977).

15555 has a large zap pit (~1 cm) on the S1 face, various penetrating fractures and a few percent vugs (figure 1). It has a subophitic, basaltic texture (figure 4) and there is little evidence for shock in the minerals. It has been found to be 3.3 b.y. old and has been exposed to cosmic rays for 80 m.y.

*Figure 2: Composition diagram for Apollo 15 basalts (best data available) showing two basic types. The olivine-normative samples have been shown to be related to one another by olivine addition or subtraction but can not be related to the pyroxene-phyric basalts (see Ryder and Shuraytz 2001).* 

Ryder (1985) carefully reviewed all aspects of 15555. It is one of the most allocated and most studied samples from the moon and it has often been used in public displays.

#### *An aside*

*The Apollo 15 basalts were all found to be the same age and therefore related in space and time. They also all have the same trace element content, but they were found to have either high or low silica contents (figure 2). In this compendium, the high silica basalts will be referred to as Pigeonite Basalts, because they have abundant pigeonite phenocrysts, and the lower-silica group as Olivinenormative Basalts. When carefully analyzed, the olivinenormative basalts could be related along an olivine fractionation line (Ryder and Shuraytz 2001). Two small, friable, coarse-grained samples are enriched in olivine (15385, 15387) and one sample (15065) has a region that is apparently enriched in mafic minerals. These rocks have notable variations in texture and mineralogy due to different gas content (vesicles and vugs) and cooling history (some have glassy matrix).* 

#### **Petrography**

Lunar sample 15555 is a coarse-grained, porphryritic rock with rounded olivine phenocrysts (1 mm) and subhedral zoned pyroxene phenocrysts (0.5-2 mm) set in a matrix of poikilitic plagioclase (up to 3 mm). Interstices between plagioclase megacrysts are filled with minor opaque minerals, silica, glass and pore space. Inclusions of small euhedral chromite crystals occur in olivine and pyroxene (figure 5). Inclusions of olivine and pyroxene are found in plagioclase (figure 6). Ni-Fe metal is rare. Small vugs are about 2-4 % by volume (figure 3).

Dalton and Hollister (1974) determined the crystallization sequence of 15555 by carefully studying the mineral zoning. At 1 atmosphere, Kesson (1975) determined experimentally that olivine crystallized at 1283 deg.C, followed by spinel at 1227 deg.C, pyroxene at 1154 deg.C and plagioclase at 1138 deg.C.

Walker et al. (1977) and Taylor et al. (1977) determined the cooling rate of 15555 (5 deg.C/day) by modeling the diffusion of Fe in olivine phenocrysts, while Bianco and Taylor (1977) determined a cooling rate (at time of olivine nucleation) of 12-24 deg.C/day from the number density of olivine crystals (grains/mm2 ).

Kesson (1975) and Walker et al. (1977) performed highpressure experiments on 15555 composition to obtain

the pressure-temperature relation for multiply saturated phases. In this way, they obtained estimates of the depth of origin for this composition of 240 km and 100-150 km respectively. However, it would be remarkably good fortune if a lunar basalt sample was representative of a true primary magma, because limited accumulation of olivine and/or opaques would greatly alter the liquid composition, and hence the phase diagram. Lunar basalts have very low viscosity. Never the less, the composition of 15555 (and/or 15016) was chosen for experiments, because it was highest in Mg, and thus, most likely to be the primitive end member.

## **Mineralogy**

*Olivine*: Bell and Mao (1972), Brown et al. (1972), Longhi et al. (1972), Walker et al. (1977) and Taylor et al. (1977) studied the zoning in olivine phenocrysts. Dalton and Hollister (1974) reported two kinds of olivine; large (1mm), normal-zoned olivine phenocrysts with Fo and small (0.1mm) euhedral inclusions in 67-29 plagioclase with Fo49-16.

(1972) presented a traverse of the zoning in a complex pyroxene in 15555 (figure 8). Boyd (1972) found pyroxene cores had

sector-zoned mantles of more Ca-rich pyroxene. Heuer et al. (1972), Nord et al. (1973) and Papike et al. (1972) studied microscopic exsolution.

**Plagioclase**: The cores of large plagioclase crystals are relatively unzoned  $(An_{94-91})$  but the rims approach  $An_{78}$ . Longhi et al. (1976) studied the change in FeO/MgO from center to rim (figure 9) and Meyer et al. (1974) studied zoning of trace elements in 15555 (figure 10). Schnetzler et al. (1973) and Brunfelt et al. (1972) determined the trace element content of plagioclase separates.

**Spinel**: Dalton and Hollister (1974) found that chromite inclusions in olivine had ulvöspinel overgrowths. The spinels in 15555 have also been studied by Haggerty et al. (1972) and El Goresy et al. (1976). Some chromite has been reduced to form exsolution of ilmenite plus Fe metal.

*Silica*: Heuer et al. (1972) identify silica found in the mesostasis as cristobalite.

**Phase Y**: Brown et al. (1972) and Peckett et al. (1972) reported a Zr-Ti-Fe phase ("phase Y") in the mesostasis which Andersen and Hinthorne (1973) were able to date by ion microprobe.

In general, 15555 is found to be typical of Apollo 15 basalts (figure 11). It is thought to be the primitive end member of the olivine-normative Apollo 15 suite (Chappell and Green 1973), and therefore suitable for high-pressure melting experiments. The rare-earthelement pattern is flat (figure 12), although agreement between labs was poor.

## **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of 15555 is given in tables 1 and 2. The lack of agreement is due to the relatively large crystal size and the small amounts distributed for analysis (see complaints lodged by Mason et al. 1972 and Rhodes and Hubbard 1973). Even Ryder and Schuraytz (2001) and Neal (2001) found significant variation in 4 gram duplicate splits.

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

15555 proved to be a good sample to resolve analytical techniques and inter-laboratory comparisons and was apparently allocated (by LAPST/CAPTEM) to each laboratory for that purpose. Argon 39/40 plateau ages were obtained by Alexander et al. (1971), Husain et al. (1971), Podosek et al. (1971) and York (1972). The most dependable ages were those obtained on plagioclase separates (figure 11).

Chappell et al. (1971), Wasserburg and Papanastassiou (1971), Murthy et al. (1971), Cliff et al. (1972) and Birck et al. (1975) determined internal mineral

isochrons by the Rb/Sr method (figures 14-17). These results are discussed in Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1973).

Tatsumoto et al. (1972) found that U/Pb data for 15555 lie on a discordia line from 4.65 to 3.3 b.y., while Tera and Wasserburg found that the whole rock data lie on a discordia line from 3.3 and 4.42 (*magic point*, see figure 18). Andersen and Hinthorne (1973) dated Urich, Y-Zr phases by ion microprobe.

Lugmair (1975) and Unruh et al. (1984) present Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf whole rock data and Nyquist et al. (1991) have dated 15555 by Sm-Nd internal isochron (figure 17). Nyquist et al. also heated the sample to 790 deg C and 990 deg C for 170 hours to see what disturbance there was to age dating (see table).

Lee et al. (1977) reported Hf/W and <sup>182</sup>W/<sup>184</sup>W.

It seems clear that this sample should be dated every few years, by whatever new technique, or new laboratory, that comes along, and that the data needs

to be compared, by CAPTEM, to understand precision and accuracy that are claimed. In this way, 15555, becomes a sort of control sample for geochronology.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Marti and Lightner (1971) determined the cosmic ray exposure age as 81 m.y. by 81Kr . Podosek et al. (1971) and York et al. (1972) determined exposure ages of 90 m.y. and 76 m.y., respectively, by 38Ar. This age in not associated with any local crater (Arvidson et al. 1975).

The lunar orientation and history of surface exposure is not well documented for 15555 and it has not often been allocated for depth profiles of cosmic ray, solar flare radionuclide studies *(however, see Fireman below)*. The large impact (figure 1) would have caused the rock to jump or roll! Behrmann et al. (1972) determined a track age of 34 m.y. and calculated that the erosion rate was about 1 mm per m.y. On the other hand, Poupeau et al. (1972) also determined the track density and concluded that the sample had been buried beneath the regolith. Bhandari et al. (1972) determined the track density (and suntan age).

#### **Other Studies**

Lunar sample 15555 was allocated for many other studies, including physical properties, spectroscopy, thermoluminescence, isotopic analysis (C, S, Th, etc. see table). Supplemental data was collected on companion samples.

Marti and Lightner (1971), Mergue (1973) and Husain (1974) reported the content and isotopic ratios for rare gasses in 15555. Fireman et al. (1972) used measurements of 3 H (tritium), 37Ar and 39Ar from different depths in 15555 (and other Apollo samples) to determine the intensity of recent and long term solar flare activity.

*Figure 12b: Normalized rare-earth-element diagram for 15555 (data from table 1a,b,c). Note the variation, but generally flat pattern.* 

Numerous experimental studies have been carried out on 15555 powder and/or synthetic mix *(but what composition should be used?).* Humphries et al. (1972), Longhi et al. (1972), Kesson (1975) and Walker et al. (1977) determined the mineral phases present at various temperatures and pressures (figures 18 and 19). If, and only if, the composition is correct and the source region contains olivine, pyroxene and plagioclase, then the depth of origin (~200 km) can be concluded from these phase diagrams.

#### **Processing**

Two slabs, cut at right angles, were made from this rock for allocations (figures 23-26). Slab ,46 is illustrated in figure 25. Slab ,57 was cut from ,48 and used for many allocations.

This large rock has been used to prepare 13 lunar sample displays, one of which is illustrated in figure 22. These are located in Edmonton, Geneva, Oakland, Yorba Linda, Denver, Washington D.C., Illinois, Kansas, Boston, Michigan, Philadelphia, Austin and Utah. Three thin sections of 15555 are also on display.
