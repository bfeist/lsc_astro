#### **Introduction**

The large, shocked, norite clast in 15455 is one of the oldest lunar materials that have been identified (~4.5 b.y.). It is surrounded and intruded by dark breccia matrix with an age about 3.9 b.y. 15455 is similar to 15445, both found on the rim of Spur Crater. It has micrometeorite craters on several surfaces and a cosmic ray exposure age about 200 m.y. Together, these two breccia samples, and the nearby boulder, are thought to represent ejecta from the Imbrium Basin (Ryder and Wood 1977, Ryder and Bower 1977 and Hertogen et al. 1977).

15455 was returned as one large piece (figures 1, 2, 3) and 22 small fragments (1-3 grams each). 15455 has been the subject of several coordinated consortia studies led by Lee Silver (1970s), John Wood (1970s) and the Norite Consortium led by Larry Nyquist (1980s). The results have previously been summarized

in the catalog by Ryder (1985). Although there have been numerous studies of this important rock, it deserves more detailed investigation.

# **Petrography**

Wilshire, Morrison and Brett (1972, original Apollo 15 catalog ), James (1977) and Ryder and Bower (1977) describe 15455 as an impact melt rock with significant clasts of plutonic rock. The matrix is described as a fragment-laden melt that has surrounded and intruded the enclosed clasts. The dark breccia matrix that makes up the majority of 15455 is coherent and dense in places and vesicular in others (figure 4). It is composed of a seriate mix of plagioclase, olivine and minor pinkspinel fragments (xenoliths) surrounded by a very finegrained igneous-textured groundmass. Pyroxene is rare in the matrix material (Ryder 1985). Spudis et al. (1991) analyzed the small mineral clasts found in the

breccia matrix, finding that they could be related to norites and troctolites, but not to basalts nor to ferroan anorthosites. James (1977) described rounded xenocrysts in the matrix of 15455 with spherulitic devitrified maskylynite (figure 5) indicating a shock

history more extreme than was experienced by the large norite clast. Christie et al. (1973) found no glass in the matrix, which they described as a dark, non-porous, annealed microbreccia.

Reid et al. (1977) found that the matrix material in 15455 had approximately the same composition as "LKFM" – a cluster of glass compositions found at several Apollo sites.

15455 contains several clasts, but only two have been studied:

#### **Significant Clasts**

**CAN** *Cataclastic Anorthositic Norite:* – The largest clast (about 200 grams, seen on S1-B1 end) is pristine norite with about 70% plagioclase, 30% orthopyroxene and trace augite (figure 7). The 15455 norite also contains a variety of accessory minerals: silica, armalcolite, chromite, ilmenite, rutile, a phosphate, zircon, baddelyite, Fe-metal and troilite (Ryder and Bower 1977).

The original grain size of this norite (CAN) was quite large (1-3 mm), but the grains are significantly fractured as if crushed and granulated while in place (Phinney et al. 1977, James 1977). Cross-cutting veins of dark matrix material cut through the white, norite material (figures 2, 22, 25-27). There is a "chill margin" surrounding this large clast (figure 6).

CAN has been the subject of the Norite Consortium led by Larry Nyquist (see Shih et al. 1993) and has been found to be extremely old (see below).

This large white clast may itself be composed of more than one material (not well established). Observations (by Wilshire and Morrison) made during the original preliminary examination were that "plagioclase ranges from 60% to more than 95% and the variation in proportion to pyroxene suggest an original layering". This is supported by the initial trace element analysis

of the white clast by Taylor et al. (1973) which is different from that by Philpotts (unpublished), Shih et al. (1993) and Warren and Wasson (1980) (Table 2 and figure 13). Warren and Wasson (1980) termed their split "c3", to distinguish it from the material "c1" originally studied by Taylor et al. (1973) and Ganapathy et al. (1973).

**CTA** *Cataclastic Troctolitic Anorthosite:* This eggshaped white clast (~3 grams) was exposed during cutting slab (figures 26 and 27). Warren and Wasson (1979) found that this clast (termed "c2") had an "extreme cataclastic texture" while Ryder and Norman (1979) found it had a "feldspathic granulite texture". It has an extremely fine grain size (100 to 350 microns) with more olivine than pyroxene (hence term troctolitic). Ganapathy et al. (1973) and Warren and Wasson (1979) found it has low meteoritic siderophile content and was thus "chemically pristine". The REE pattern is not unlike that of the norite (figure 14).

**XYZ** *Complex:* This set of unstudied white clasts on W1 end is shown in figures 1 and 23.

*C, D, E, F:* Small white clasts exposed by saw cut (~1 gram ea.) as designated in catalog by Ryder (1985). D may be part of XYZ above (see figure 26). These clasts have not been studied and will prove to be difficult to extract in the glove box.

# **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Ryder and Bower (1977) and Spudis et al. (1991) find olivine ranges in composition Fo90-75 in the matrix but Fo82 in CTA (figure 10).

*Plagioclase:* Ryder and Bower (1977) showed plagioclase was An96-83 in the matrix, but that it was An in clasts CAN and CTA (figure 11). 96-92

*Metallic iron:* Hewins and Goldstein (1975) reported metal in norite clast with up to 10% Co.

#### **Chemistry**

Tables 1, 2 and 3 give the chemical composition of the matrix, and two largest clasts: the "norite" (CAN) and the "troctolite" (CTA).

Blanchard and McKay (1980) reported whole rock and mineral composition data for the cataclastic anorthositic norite clast (CAN) and determined that the parent liquid was already highly "evolved" when it formed (figure 15). Philpotts (unpublished), Shih et al. (1993) and Warren and Wasson (1980) analyzed the norite clast (CAN) finding similar results, but different from that of Taylor et al. (1973) (figure 13).

Although the mineral mode and major element chemistry is different, Warren and Wasson (1979) found the CTA clast has a trace element signature similar to that of CAN (table 3, figure 14). Thus, this troctolitic anorthosite is related to the norite suite rather than the feroan anorthosites (figure 11). *Figure 20: Nd/Sm mineral isochron for 15455,228* 

Taylor et al. (1972, 1973), Philpotts (unpublished) and Lindstrom et al. (1988) analyzed the matrix (Table 1, figure 12). Ganapathy et al. (1973) showed that matrix had high Ir and Au while Ganapathy et al. (1973) and Warren and Wasson (1979 and 1980) showed that the clasts were free of meteoritic tracers Ir and Au (hence termed "pristine").

Lindstrom et al. (1988), Hertogen et al. (1977) and Nyquist et al. (1979) showed that the impact melt rock matrix of 15455 and that of 15445 were chemically similar (figure 17). It is thought the matrix represents ejecta from the Imbrium Basin.

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Shih et al. (1993) found that the norite clast was very old (4.59 ± 0.13, figure 19). Shih et al. (1993) and Alexander and Kahl (1974) determined Ar/Ar plateau ages for the dark matrix (3.94 b.y.) and the light clast (3.82 b.y.) – inconsistent with textural relationships (figure 1). It is clear that the Ar/Ar age of the norite clast was partially reset.

Silver (1973) determined U, Th and Pb isotopes in both the matrix and the white clast (Table 5).

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Keith et al. (1973) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 22Na = 42 dpm/kg., 26Al = 70 dpm/kg., 54Mn = 10 dpm/kg., 56Co = 6 dpm/kg. and 46Sc = 5 dpm/kg. Alexander and Kahl (1974) determined 38Ar exposure age to be 205 ± 21 m.y., while Bernstein (1983) determined 190 m.y.

# **Processing**

Numerous small pieces broke off of 15455 during return to Earth (figures 28 – 35). Additional pieces broke off while clamping down for the saw cut (figure 22). The sample broke up further during the second saw cut (figure 24).

Sawing exposed additional white clasts (figures 21 23). The egg-shaped clast CTA proved interesting. Sawing also showed the details of veining of the large norite clast (figure 21).

There are 34 thin sections of 15455 (table 4).
