### **Introduction**

Lunar sample 15459 is a large, dense, regolith breccia from Spur Crater which has a mineral, glass and chemical composition like that of the local soil. It contains a large clast of picritic mare basalt that has been dated as 3.2 - 3.3 b.y., as well as a wide mixture of clasts of highland rock types from the Apennine Front (figure 1). The matrix contains brown glass and a mixture of glass particles with a wide range of compositions (Ridley 1975, 1977). The proportions of glass compositions closely matches that of the soil, proving that this breccia sample was produced by compaction and some fusion of local soil.

Ryder (1985) gives a nice review of what was known about 15459 as of 1985. Large pieces of this sample are used as public displays.

## **Petrography**

Phinney et al. (1972) reported that the majority of the breccia samples from Spur Crater had a brown glass matrix; 15459 is one of these, 15465 is another (Cameron and Delano 1973). The matrix makes up about 50% of the mass and is relatively dense; 2.76 gm/cm3 (Chung and Westphal 1973), 2.84 gm/cm3 (Wentworth and McKay 1984; McKay et al. 1989). Micrometeorite craters can be seen in the photos of some surfaces (T1, S1)

Ridley (1975, 1977) and McKay and Wentworth (1983) <sup>1000</sup> classify 15459 as a regolith breccia, because it is found to contain numerous glass spheres and shards, including <sup>100</sup> the green glass compositions found in abundance in sample/ chondrites the soils around Spur Crater. The bulk composition of the matrix is also very similar to that of the soil at Spur <sup>10</sup> Crater (figure 3). McKay et al. (1974, 1989) classify 15459 as submature with Is/FeO = 17-27, however, <sup>1</sup> relict agglutinates are hard to identify. Solar wind rare gas content is moderately high (McKay et al. 1989). The clast population is seriate (figures 2, 4, 19) and of 0.1 highland, rather than mare composition. In a series of papers (Lindstrom et al. 1987, 1989, 1990; Marvin et al. 1991; Nyquist et al. 1989) report analyses of numerous small clasts mined from 15459 (see figures and tables herein). A wide variety of clasts were found; from anorthositic, to noritic, impact melt, KREEP, QMD and picritic basalt. However, clasts of quartznormative basalt from the local mare are absent. The large clasts in 15459 (figure 1) were studied by Ridley (1975, 1977).

## **Significant Clasts**

Large picritic basalt clast: The large, coarse-grained, basalt clast (figures 1 and 2) has been studied by Hubbard et al. (1974), Ridley (1975, 1977) and Nyquist et al. (1989). It is more mafic than the Apollo 15 basalts (figure 6), but with a rare-earth-element pattern like that of a basalt (figure 7). Olivine is zoned from Fo<sub>67</sub> to Fo<sub>52</sub>; pyroxene from En<sub>70</sub>Wo<sub>5</sub> to En<sub>40</sub>Wo<sub>40</sub> (Nyquist et al. 1989, Ridley 1975). The age has been determined by Ar/Ar as 3.33 b.y (Stettler et al. 1973, figure 8) and Rb/Sr as 3.22 b.y. (Nyquist et al. 1989, figure 9). This large clast measures  $\sim 4 \times 8 \times 4$  cm.

**The "white" poikilitic clast:** This large "white" clast, seen in figure 1, has not been well documented. It is apparently a cataclastic, poikilitic highland rock with

high percentage of calcic plagioclase (Ridley 1975, 1977). It may include a clast of norite (Takeda 1973). Hubbard et al. (1973), Janghorbani et al. (1973) and Ganapathy et al. (1973) provide chemical analyses (table 3a). Reid et al. (1977) picture the texture of this poikilitic clast (their fig. 1b) and considered it in their search for LKFM basalt. Pyroxenes in this clast are exsolved (ie. inverted) in a manner similar to a plutonic rock (figures 10 and 11).

White "hidden" clast: There appears to be another large white clast (hidden under the patina, figure 1) on the large piece (,184) that went to remote storage (see also figure 20). This clast may have been the one

analyzed by Taylor et al. (1973) (,97?, table 3a). It is apparently otherwise unstudied.

KREEP basalt: Small fragments of KREEP basalt (sometimes mistakenly termed norite) are said to be abundant, although generally smeared-out in texture (Ridley 1975, 1977). These fragments have pyroxenes with Mg-orthopyroxene cores, zoning to ferropigeonite (figure 14). Glass of the same composition is also found in abundance in the matrix. Lindstrom et al. (1988) analyzed several clasts with this composition (table 3b, figure 15).

**Quartz Monzodiorite Clast:** The QMD clast ( ,316) in 15459 contains 2% silica, 59% plagioclase ( $An_{44}$ <sub>88</sub>), 39% pyroxene exsolved as  $En_{28}Wo_4$  and  $En_{23}Wo_{41}$ , with trace zircon, K-spar, ilmenite and whitlockite (Marvin et al. 1991). It has been somewhat deformed and recrystallized. Analysis by Lindstrom et al. (1988) shows high REE content (figure 15) like that of KREEP basalt, and similar to QMD from other samples (see 15405).

**Ferroan Norite:** Clast ,279 is a shocked and granulated norite consisting of 65% plagioclase  $(An_{93})$ , 33% pyroxene  $(En_{66}Wo_2)$ , with rare augite  $(En_{42}Wo_{45})$ , ilmenite, chromite, K-spar, silica, whitlockite and zircon. Clast ,292 is a coarse-grained norite with 48%

Figure 9: Rb-Sr isochron for large picritic basalt clast in 15459 (from Nyquist et al. 1989)

plagioclase ( $An_{91}$ ), 50% pyroxene ( $En_{60}Wo_3$ ), minor augite ( $En_{41}Wo_{44}$ ), trace ilmenite, chromite, zircon, silica, K-spar, troilite and metal. The analyses by Lindstrom et al. (1988) are plotted in figure 12.

**Ferroan Anorthosite:** Clast ,274 is mostly coarse plagioclase ( $An_{97}$ ) with only minute pyroxene (figures 16, 17, 18). Clast ,238 is a cataclastic anorthositic norite with 61% plagioclase ( $An_{95.98}$ ), 29% pyroxene ( $En_{67}Wo_2$  and  $En_{41}Wo_{46}$ ), 10% olivine ( $Fo_{60}$ ), with accessory chromite and ilmenite. Trace element contents are low (figure 18), but keep the small sample size in mind.

**Magnesian anorthosite:** Clast ,231w is mainly plagioclase (An<sub>90.93</sub>), with scattered olivine (Fo<sub>69-72</sub>), and augite (En<sub>47</sub>Wo<sub>42</sub>). High Eu in this clast (figure 18) might be due to excess plagioclase.

#### Chemistry

The composition of the matrix of breccia 15459 is remarkably similar to that of soil 15301 from Spur Crater (figure 3).

The composition of the large picritic basalt clast is more mafic than the typical Apollo 15 basalts (figures 6 and 7, table 2).

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Stettler et al. (1973) and Nyquist et al. (1989) have dated the large picritic mare basalt clast in 15459 (figures 8 and 9). These ages are not concordant, possibly because of the reheating during breccia formation (time, temperature unknown).

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Stettler et al. (1973) determined an exposure age of 520 m.y. by the 38Ar method.

Keith et al. (1972) reported cosmic ray activity as 26Al = 120 dpm/kg., 22Na = 39 dpm/kg., 54Mn = 16 dpm/kg., 56Co = 8 dpm/kg. and 46Sc = 3.9 dpm/kg.

### **Processing**

15459 was originally studied by a consortium led by Paul Gast (see Ridley 1975, 1977).

Figure 20 illustrates the main aspects of the break-up of 15459 for allocation and displays. A large piece (,6 = 160 grams) was removed from the west end for display (figure 23). Another piece was removed, by wire saw, from the east end (,55 – 92) that included part of the "white" poikilitic clast analyzed by Taylor et al. (1973) and Hubbard et al. (1973).

In 1975 a saw cut was made thru the middle of the sample to create a large piece (,184 = 1276 grams) for remote storage, and another display (,173 = 86 grams). In 1985, a slab was cut, with many allocations of small clasts to Lindstrom and Marvin (described herein).

Additional cuts were made of the large piece in 1996, to prepare a large display sample (,447) for the U.S. National Museum at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC (see location of cuts in figure 2).
