# Drill Core 170 grams

#### **Introduction**

In 1974, after successfully entering earth orbit, flying to the moon, entering lunar orbit, and descending toward the surface, the Luna 23 spacecraft was damaged during landing in Mare Crisium (Sea of Crises). The sample collecting apparatus could not operate and no samples were returned. The lander continued transmissions for three days after landing. Then in 1976, Luna 24 successfully collected a drill core sample from Mare Crisium and returned it to Earth automatically. According to Barsukov (1977) the drill penetrated into the regolith 225 cm on an angle with a vertical depth of ~ 200 cm. However, the actual length of the returned core was 160 cm, with total weight of 170 grams. Samples were exchanged with the US, Great Britain, India and other countries.

Duke (1976) wrote: "The samples were obtained with a rotary drill which could be driven alternately by percussion if the core became lodged. The material flowed through the bit, which was 8 mm in diameter, into a plastic liner that was slightly wider. When drill was complete, the liner was extracted from the drill by pulling on a series of strips attached to the inside of the liner along its length. The liner, which

"On opening in the laboratory, it was found that the upper 50-60 cm of the liner was empty -

- The Russians tentatively identified approximately 20 horizons on the basis of soil color, granularity, etc. The uppermost portion of the core may be relatively more disturbed than the lower. At the top of the core, a concentration of millimeter-sized fragments of soil and agglutinaceous material occur, apparently devoid of fines. The explanation for this is unclear. In the lower portion of the core, some very sharply defined boundaries exist. At 170 cm, a uniform layer of crushed gabbroic rocks, 2 cm thick, with sharp boundaries both above and below, is conspicuously lighter than the soil."

Following transfer to the US, Luna 24 samples were processed and described in a catalog by Nagle and Walton (1977) and then distributed to US investigators. A conference on Luna 24 was documented in a book titled "Mare Crisium: The view from Luna 24".

The geologic setting for Luna 24 is outlined in Butler and Morrison (1977) and also presented, *in Cyrillic*, by Florensky et al. (1980) and Head et al. (1980).

The main finding of Luna 24 was that a very-low Ti basalt was extruded at 3.3 b.y. (considerably after the basin formation).

#### **Petrography**

The Luna 24 core tube was found to contain an abundance of small basalt fragments with unusual low Ti content (Ryder et al. 1978, Taylor et al. 1978). These became known as VLT basalts (see separate essay on 24170). Tables 2 -5 give the composition of some of these basalt fragments (figure 8). In addition to the VLT basalt, there are a number of other different basalt types present, including an abundant brown glass (table 6) which might be volcanic liquid sprayed up into the sky.

At the 24170-174 layer there was a coarse-grained, lighter-colored area that was termed "gabbro", which might have been a friable rock that was broken up. Throughout the core small "gabbros" have been reported (e.g. Lu et al. 1989). These fragments are probably basalts, because the pyroxene is zoned in composition.

In addition to VLT basalt, there is another kind of basaltic particle in Luna 24 fines that was not seen in Apollo sample. It is termed "metabasalt" and is characterized by a fine-grained granular texture and Fe-rich pyroxene exsolution trend (figure 9). It has the same bulk composition as the igneous textured basalts.

and others determined the mode along the length of the core. Simon et al. (1981) compares the mode of the bulk Luna 24 core tube with that of other missions (figure 3). The mode reported by Taylor et al. is the most interesting in that it is based on study of a significant number of large particles (see table). Bence and Grove (1978) carefully counted the numbers and types of highland fragments which make up about 2% of the Luna 24 soil.

Morris R.V. (1978) found that the maturity of Luna 24 samples was submature to immature, decreasing with depth. McKay et al. (1978) and Taylor et al. (1978) found a similar decrease in agglutinate content with depth. Basu et al. (1978) determined the grain size distribution (figure 7).

KREEP is rare at Luna 24. Three individual particles have been reported (Blanchard et al. 1978, Ma et al. 1978 and Kurat and Kracker 1981), but there is no evidence for significant KREEP in the REE pattern of the soil (figure 11).

#### **Chemistry**

Ma et al. (1978) showed that the Luna 24 core is homogeneous from top to bottom (figure 11). The best average composition of Luna 24 is probably the one obtained by Laul et al. (1981) from a combined sample 24999 (table 1).

Ebihara et al. (1992), Ma and Schmitt (1977) , Blanchard et al. (1978) analyzed several small rock fragments from Luna 24 (table 2, figure 10).

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

Schaeffer et al. (1978), Wasserburg et al. (1978), Stettler and Albarede (1978) and Birck et al. (1977) reported ages for Luna 24 basalt particles (figure 12). The Sm/Nd age (3.3 ± 0.05 b.y.) is probably the most accurate, but it is based on only two points! However, it is concordant with the Ar/Ar age. Additional samples need to be measured.

### **Other Studies**

Rare gases were measured by Bogard and Hirsch (1978) along the length of the core, concluding that the material represented by the core did not have any simple exposure nor depositional history.

The density of fossil nuclear tracks from solar and cosmic rays was determined from many mineral grains along the core, but no buried exposure horizon could be found (figure 13). Goswami et al. (1978), Kashkarov et al.(1978), Blanford and Wood (1978), Chaillou et al. (1978), Crozaz (1978), Poupeau et al.(1978) and others reported track distributions, generally finding that material at the bottom of the core had less exposure to solar wind that material at the top. Again, no simple history for this core.

#### **Processing**

The initial processing of Luna 24 core is described by Tarasov et al. (1980) *in Cyrillic.* The core liner, made of plastic, was unwound from the spacecraft "drum" and wound in a coil (snail) for X-ray (figure 2). It was then placed in sections in 6 trays where each segment was slit lengthwise and dumped into the tray, such that relative depth orientations was maintained (figure 15). Luna 24 samples were processed in a more advanced cabinet than was used for Luna 16 and 20.

Many samples, from different depths were, provided to the US, England, France, India and the Czech republic (figure 14). The initial samples transferred to the US, were sieved, split and cataloged by Nagle and Walton (1977) and also described by Nagle (1978)(figure 6). Two additional samples were obtained by Larry Taylor in 1987 (Lu et al. 1989).
