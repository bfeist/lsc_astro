#### **Introduction**

Luna 16 was, in fact, the third mission to collect samples of the Moon (*there were no known lunar meteorites at the time*). The automatic Luna 16 station collected a 36 cm deep core into the regolith and successfully returned it to Earth in a small capsule. A large book (*in Cyrillic*) is dedicated to the study of the Luna 16 samples by scientists from all over the world (ed. Vinogradov 1974). A booklet from India, and volume 13 of EPSL also contain additional early publications. *This humble summary is simply an attempt to pull together some of what's now known about this remarkable achievement.* 

Vinogadov (1971) gives a complete description of the 35 cm long Luna 16 core, which was subdivided into 5 principle zones (A – E, figure 10). The grain size and overall characteristics of the Luna 16 sample are similar to mare soils returned by the Apollo missions. Basalt fragments make up the majority of the sample and they have been dated at 3.4 b.y. The basalts from this region appear to be more aluminous than most of the Apollo basalts.

The geologic setting for Luna 16 is outlined in McCauley and Scott (1972) and Florensky et al. (1974)(*in Cyrillic*). The landing was on a mare surface of an old basin (Fecunditatis). Rays formed by material ejected from craters Langrenus (250 km south),

#### **Petrography**

Vinogradov (1971) found that the Luna core was coarser (on average) with depth (figure 1). Grain size distributions are given in Stakheyev et al. (1974)(*in Cyrillic*).

Reid et al. (1972), Bence et al. (1972) and Tarasov et al. (1974; *in Cyrillic)* published modes showing that about 20% of the fragments are fine-grained basalts (figure 7). Simon et al. (1981) gives the mode in a manner that can be compared with other samples (see table and figure 6).

The small (62 mg) basalt fragment B1 was described by Albee et al. (1972) and is featured separately (*see 21020*). Grieve et al. (1972) described 3 additional basalt fragments (total weight 1.88 mg). The bulk analyses of these basalt are similar Table 2) and they all have iron rich pyroxene (figures ). Bence et al. (1972), Steele and Smith (1972), Hollister and Kulik (1972), Tarasov et al. (1974) and others all reported on the petrography of various small fine-grained basalt fragments from the Luna 16 core.

Reid and Jakes (1974), Kurat et al. (1976) and Cimbalnikova et al. (1977) recognized that a fair portion of the Luna 16 basalts are "aluminous" in character (table 2b).

#### **Mineralogy**

Numerous investigators reported on the composition of pyroxene grains in basalt fragments and soils (figures 5a,b,c,d).

Haggerty (1972), studied the opaques in the Luna 16 soil, finding that the spinels followed a slightly different trend from the Apollo samples.

Jakes et al. (1972), Keil et al. (1972), Jin and Taylor (1990) and Simon et al. (1981) determined the chemical composition of numerous glass particles in an attempt to identify "rock types" that may be present in the area around the landing site. Apparently about half the glass comes from the nearby highland (figure 9). Ivanov et al. (1974) and Glass (1974) also studied glass beads from Luna 16 (*published in Cyrillic*). Glass of volcanic origin is still to be identified.

### **Chemistry**

Vinogradov (1971), Laul et al. (1981) and others determined the bulk composition and the composition of various grain size separates (table 1). Various individual basalt fragments and other lithic fragments were also analyzed (table 2). The Ti and Mg contents of basalts is plotted in figure 7 and compared with basalts from other lunar missions. Various investigators noticed that Luna 16 basalts are more aluminous than most basalts returned by Apollo missions. The rare earth element pattern for the soil is exactly parallel to that of the basalts (figure 8).

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1972) and Huneke et al. (1972) determined concordant Rb-Sr and Ar-Ar ages (~3.4 b.y.) for one of the larger basalt fragments (21020) from Luna 16 (*see 21020*). Cadogen and Turner (1977) and Kirsten and Horn (1977) attempted to date Luna 16 particles. Vinogradov (1974) also reported age data.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Huneke et al. (1972) determined an exposure age of 475 m.y. by 38Ar for basalt B. Russ (1972) determined the exposure to low energy neutrons.

#### **Other Studies**

A wide variety of experiments were performed on Luna 16 samples, because these were among the very first samples of the Moon (*see big book in Cyrillic*). Numerous investigators studied the cosmic-ray induced tracks in grains along the Luna 16 core (Agrawal et al. 1974, Bhandari et al. 1974, Berdot et al. 1972, Phakey and Price 1972, Walker and Zimmerman 1972). Oxygen isotopes were measured by Clayton (1972). Rare gas measurements were made by Heymann et al. (1972), Kaiser (1972), Pepin et al. (1972), Rao et al. (1974), (Vinogradov 1974) and others. As in the case of Apollo, Luna samples were examined by Mossbauer (Malyssheva 1974, Nady et al. 1974), EPR (Marov et al. 1974), ESCA (Vinogradov et al. 1974), Infrared (Akhmanova et al. 1974), cathodoluminescence (Spivak et al. 1974) spectroscopy (*publications in Cyrillic*).

### **Processing**

The initial reception and preliminary description of Luna 16 samples was nicely documented by Vinogradov (1974), Surkov et al. (1974) and Stakheyev et al. (1974) *in Cyrillic.* There appear to be two chambers involved - an initial processing cabinet (or vacuum tank) and a round examination cabinet. Samples were processed in an inert gas (N2?) to protect them from moisture, oxygen, and contamination.

A description of the Luna 16 samples as studied by the US investigators is given on page 223 of EPSL vol. 13. Sample A (1.5 g) was from 6-8 cm A level in core. Sample B was a basalt fragment (62 mg) from the 15 – 28 cm zone. Sample G (1.5 g) was from the 29-31 cm level. The US devised its own numbering system (figures). Additional samples were obtained in 1979

and 1987. Samples were also distributed to other countries (see list).

Sample A (21000) was sieved and split into 21001-5 according to grain size. Sample G (21010) was also sieved and split into 21011-15. A portion of the unsieved sample A (21000) was separately sieved by the Papike team in 1981.

Sample 21020 is a nice basalt and 21036 is apparently mostly a soil breccia.

The Smithsonian Institution made 21 very nice thin sections of Luna 16 (see list in Reid et al. 1971). Various investigators made a large number of grain mounts (there is a need for a Texas style "roundup")!.
