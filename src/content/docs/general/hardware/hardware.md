*Figure 1: The most important hardware for drilling on the moon is the spacesuit, the ladder and the rocket to get back.* 

Judy Allton went to a lot of trouble to catalog the tools and containers used on Apollo (Allton 1989). Tom Sullivan went on to query everyone involved to find out how well they worked (Sullivan 1994). Eric Jones has created an Apollo Lunar Surface Journal that documents what the astronauts were saying as they used the tools – during Mans' Greatest Adventure.

*Figure 2: The second most important thing is to practice drilling, over and over again, in a sandpile of sorts. Define sandpile.* 

*Figure 3: Drive tubes used on early Apollo missions were 2 cm diameter with odd shaped core catchers (that didn't work right). S69-31856.* 

*S71-16525 Figure 4: Apollo 15, 16 and 17 (called Science Missions) had drive tubes 4 cm diameter (note the rammer jammer).* 

*Figure 5: One deep drill core each was taken at Apollo 15, 16 and 17 (diameter 2 cm, length ~ 3 meters) S89-25295*
