## **Disclaimer 1**

*The Lunar Sample Compendium contains a succinct summary of ~1200 lunar samples. Only basic information is presented. Considerable effort has been made to reference the data to the original publication, which the reader should consult for accuracy, rather than copy from this compilation. Each sample contains references, and there is a comprehensive reference list.* 

## **Disclaimer 2**

*Decay constants for radioactive elements (ie. Rb) used in this Compendium are those used by the original investigators and the ages of samples may need to be recalculated (and isochrones replotted).* 

## **Disclaimer 3**

*Most photographs in this Compendium have poor color control, because they have been scanned in from old photographs. However, photo numbers are given in case someone wants a superior image, and the new online lunar catalog has true-color, digitized photos available for downloading.* 

## **Disclaimer 4**

*Chuck Meyer was the sole author of this compendium and is fully responsibility for the many mistakes in spelling, typos, omissions, slights, interpretation and accuracy of reporting. And, it is what it is, a bit off and ephemeral.*
