## **Synopsis of Deep Lunar Drill Strings**

#### **Introduction**

The literature on the collection and study of the Apollo deep drill cores is spread out (see most recent references attached). Perhaps the best review is found in Heiken et al. (1992). These cores were collected because it was hoped that they would represent material laid down slowly over time, allowing the collection of samples that were exposed to the solar wind in the distant past. It is still not certain whether this is the case or not. It would seem that the material in the cores is relatively homogeneous – no distinct ancient surfaces could be discerned. It also seems that the materials at the bottoms of the drill cores (2-3 meters deep), was last exposed on the lunar surface ~ 1 b.y. ago.

The deep drill strings obtained during the last three Apollo missions (one each) are probably among the most important samples collected, because they were studied quantitatively for isotopic changes induced by the interaction of cosmic rays with the lunar regolith (e.g. Nishiizumi et al. 1976; Curtis and Wasserburg 1975, 1977; Pepin et al. 1975). Knowledge of density and exact depth is required to interpret this data (Allton and Waltz 1980).

The Apollo drilling experience was successful – samples were collected and it was shown that drilling can be done, down to 3 meters. Drilling was also successful on the three Luna missions where a percussion-rotary drill was used to penetrate (on a 30 deg. angle) about 1.6 meters (Barsukov 1977).

#### **The Apollo Drill**

The Apollo drill used rotary-percussion action (280 rpm, 2270 blows/minute @ 40 in-pounds/blow). The hollow drill strings were made up of 6-8 segments (ea.

40 cm long, by 2 cm i.d.) with fluted wall on outside to act as auger. Drilling was a complicated dynamic exercise, as the astronauts "held back" on the drill as it augered in. Drill strings were hard to extract from holes. Drill strings could be broken down into 40 cm segments for return to earth (some segments were brought back connected). Core catchers and plugs did not stay in place (Sullivan 1994), but generally the sample remained in place, and stratigraphy was maintained (except for 60005).

The drill was also used to emplace heat flow probes (2 each site/~2 m deep). The second A15 probe broke, the CDR tripped over the cable at A16, but the A17 heat flow probes were successfully emplaced. A neutron probe was successfully inserted into the empty A17 drill hole, which was locatable by the plate used to extract core (Preliminary Science Reports).

#### **Soil Mechanics**

The wall of the Apollo 17 drill hole did not collapse and the samples appeared cohesive when dissected. The walls of trenches also were maintained during trenching indicating cohesiveness of regolith. There was a whole PI ship dedicated to the understanding of "soil mechanics" with its own resulting literature (Preliminary Science Reports, Mitchell et al. 1974).

The density of core tubes may not exactly correspond to the regolith, because of the "ro-tap" action during drilling, shaking during extraction, weightlessness and various "G" forces during transit to earth (figure 1). However, rough stratigraphy of the sample was apparently maintained.

The density of the lunar regolith should be expected to increase with depth (due to pounding by meteorite bombardment), but this is not supported by the drill string data. The top of the A17 drill string was dense, because of abundant coarse mare basalt material. The A15 data are variable and the A16 data are generally low. However, generally, drive tube and trenches found more loose material near the top and more compacted material at depth.

Although preliminary tests were done, and the drill was carefully engineered, Carrier (1974) mentions that fullscale drill tests of stratified simulants were never performed to determine quantitatively the "depth relationship". This is probably very dependent on the

dynamics of drilling and how much the astronaut/ operator "holds back" on the drill.

#### **Maturity**

The maturity of the lunar regolith is measured by Is / FeO, rare gas content, agglutinate % and/or grain size distribution (Heiken et al. 1992). Housley et al. (1975) and Morris (1976) showed that the relative ferromagnetic resonance (Is /FeO), due to finely-divided Fe metal, is an excellent indication of soil reworking due to micrometeorite bombardment. Thin sections have been prepared and studied along the entire length of the drill cores (except segment 60005).

#### **Apollo 15**

Heiken et al. (1976) detail the maturity and petrography of the Apollo 15 drill string (figure 2). Maturity decreases with depth in this core. The upper 40-45 cm has been "reworked" and has a high maturity. It is thought that the remainder of the A15 core (200 cm) was deposited as a single unit about 420 m.y. ago (Pepin et al. 1974, Curtis and Wasserburg 1977), because the radiogenic nuclides follow a well defined profile. Goswami and Lal (1979) reviewed the track density data for the A15 deep drill.

#### **Apollo 16**

Gose and Morris (1977) give the Is/FeO for the Apollo 16 drill string (figure 3). Vaniman et al. (1976) identify 4 distinct stratigraphic units (A-D) in the A16 drill string. The upper unit (6 cm) had fewer mafic mineral fragments than the rest of the core. The basal unit (35 cm) has been recognized as an ancient regolith (Bogard and Hirsch 1976). Meyer and McCallister (1977) carefully reviewed the data for the A16 core and concluded that accumulation of material has taken place

over 1 b.y. and that the material is predominantly locally derived highlands origin. Segment 5 (middle) of the A16 drill was largely empty (Duke and Nagle 1974), possibly due to spillage on the way back. The double drive tube 60009/10 has often been studied instead of the deep drill (Korotev 1991).

Sutton (in Ulrich et al. 1981) notes that the A16 core stems went easily into the soil, and that the LM area where the core was taken was only loosely compacted.

#### **Apollo 17**

The uppermost 18 cm of the 3 meter deep Apollo 17 drill string is fine-grained sediment composed of fragments of glass, regolith breccia, and agglutinate (Vaniman and Papike 1977). It overlies a fresh, dense, coarse basalt-rich unit 65 cm deep. The lower portion contains a mixture of local basalt and highlands components (Wolfe et al. 1981). Pepin et al. (1975) found that cosmic-ray-induced spallation of rare gases is not compatible with lengthy in-place radiation. Curtis and Wasserburg (1975) proposed that the deep core was deposited within the last 100 m.y. Goswami and Lal (1979) determined a 600 m.y. history for the A17 deep drill, and found episodic increases in track density. Langevin and Nagle (1981) review the evidence for a more lengthy history (~1 b.y.).

Morris et al. (1979) present the maturity index as a function of depth in the Apollo 17 deep drill (figure 4) while Taylor et al. (1979) give the agglutinate count (figure 5). Laul and Papike (1981) find that the Apollo 17 drill samples are heterogeneous with depth and define 5 stratigraphic units (A-E; figure 6).

#### **Processing**

The Apollo drill strings were milled open along their length and dissected (figure 7). Observations made during dissection were recorded in the core catalog, and numerous PI letters, by Duke and Nagle (1976). After dissection, a special "peel" was made, after which the stratigraphy was best seen (Fryxell and Heiken 1974). Material remaining in the bottom of the core after the dissection and peel, was impregnated with epoxy and made into thin sections (see attached tables). A long segment with a sawn surface remains encapsulated in epoxy - see collages under individual sample numbers which perhaps provide the best illustration of the "nature of the regolith."
