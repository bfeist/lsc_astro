## **Introduction**

Lunar sample 24170 represents a portion of a layer of rather coarse particles (>1 mm) from the upper portion of Unit IV of the Luna 24 core that was collected, automatically, from Mare Crisium. It has been interpreted as a piece of coarse basalt (gabbro?) that was crushed during the coring operation (Barsukov 1978; Ryder et al. 1977) and has been studied by Tarasov et al. (1977), FOCUS (1977), the Lunatic Asylum (1978), Unruh and Tatusomoto (1978), Ryder et al. (1977) and others. It was successfully dated by the Lunatic Asylum (1978) at 3.3 b.y.

Additional fragments of VLT (very low titanium) ferrobasalt were studied from the Luna 24 core. Papike and Vaniman (1978) describe these particles as ophitic,

with olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts, small euhedral chromite, subhedral ulvospinel and residual patches of ilmenite, silica, Fe-pyroxene and K-enriched glass.

## **Petrography**

Most of the mineral fragments from the coarse layer at depth 170 cm in the Luna 24 core are apparently broken from a relatively coarse (~ 1mm), ophitic, mare basalt (figures 1, 2). The minerals are Fe-rich, so the term "ferrobasalt" seems appropriate. The pyroxene and plagioclase grains are highly, and complexly, zoned, so the term "micrograbbro" (often used) does not seem appropriate. Estimates of the mineral mode for this layer are given in the table.

## **Mineralogy**

*Pyroxenes:* The pyroxene grains in L24170 were analyzed by numerous teams including: Tarasov et al. (1977), Bence et al. (1977), Ryder et al. (1977), Taylor et al. (1978) and the Lunatic Asylum (1978). They are found to be highly zoned from Fe-rich pigeonite and clinopyroxene to hedenbergite and a "final" pyroxene Wo20En5 Fs75 (Papike and Vaniman 1978)(figure 3).

*Olivine:* Olivine is abundant in this layer (10%) and found to be chemically zoned from Fo58 to Fo5 (figure 3).

*Plagioclase:* The feldspar in L24170 is ophitically intergrown with both olivine and pyroxene. It is zoned from An90 to An86 (Papike and Vaniman 1978).

*Spinels:* The opaques in L24170 were studied by Haggerty (1978). The spinels are split in two endmember compositions ulvospinel and chromite.

# **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of this layer was determined by Barsukov (1977) (table 1). Ma et al. (1978) determined the composition of mineral separates (figure 4). Comparison with other lunar basalt compositions is made in figures 5 and 6.

## **Radiogenic age dating**

The Lunatic Asylum (1978) was able to successfully date this basalt by Sm-Nd internal mineral isochron (figure 7) and concordant argon release plateau (figure 8) as 3.3 ± 0.4 b.y. However, attempts to date small amounts of this fragmented material by Rb-Sr and U-Pb generally proved unsuccessful (see table).

## **Other Studies**

Numerous other studies were conducted on Luna 24 samples. Most of these are reported in the book titled Mare Crisium.

## **Processing**

This unique sample was collected automatically as a long drill (~200 cm) from Mare Crisium. The fiberenforced core liner was wound around a drum, during which most of the top 60 cm were lost (on the Moon). The samples was processed in the USSR (figure 10), followed by a trade with the US and other countries. Each of the US splits (except this layer) was sieved and cataloged by Nagle and Walton (1977). A conference was held and a whole book written titled Mare Crisium: The view from Luna 24 (eds. Papike and Merrill)

*It would seem important to chronicle and analyze the steps taken in the collection and study of these small samples, with the hope of documenting "lessons learned" for possibly future unmanned sampling missions.*
