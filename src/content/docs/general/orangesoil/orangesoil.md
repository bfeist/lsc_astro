## **Introduction**

The orange soil samples discovered at Shorty Crater, Apollo 17, consists of three samples of the trench pictured in figure 1 (74220, 74240 and 74260) and an adjacent double drive tube (74002-74001). 74220 and most of the drive tube are nearly pure orange glass, while 74240 and 74260 and the top 5 cm of the drive tube are mixtures of orange glass and local mare soil. A high portion of the orange glass in the drive tube is devitrified, and now black, due to fine olivine needles and ilmenite feathers. This is often referred to as "black

glass", but compositionally, it is found to be the same as the orange glass.

The orange and black glass samples were identified as a pyroclastic deposit (Heiken et al. 1974, Meyer et al. 1975, Heiken and McKay 1977). Other origins (vapor condensation, impact) have been considered and rejected. Roedder and Weiblen (1973) considered an origin by meteorite impact into a lava lake, but this hypothesis has also been discounted.

Mafic volcanic glasses are found all over the moon (Delano 1986), but the Orange Soil (74220) and the Green Glass Clods (15425-7) are the "type samples"for pyroclastic deposits. The Orange Soil was found to be enriched volatile elements (Zn, Pb, S, Cl etc) and the glass beads were found to have a thin coating of condensed volatiles (Meyer et al 1975, Butler and

Meyer 1976). The Orange Soil generally contains high levels of endogenous Ni (not due to meteorite contamination), as well as significant amounts of highly-siderophile-elements (Re, Os etc) that seem to be due to meteoritic contamination (Walker et al. 2004).

While the age of the orange glass is known to be about 3.6 b.y. (the same age as the mare basalts), the exact age of Shorty Crater has remained elusive (Eugster et

al. 1981, Bogard and Hirsch 1978, Crozaz 1979). The cratering event that caused Shorty Crater would surely have modified these samples, as they were collected from the rim of the crater.

## **Petrography**

Although the orange soil is nearly pure orange glass, only about 1/3 of the sample is unbroken spheres and ovoids, while about 2/3 is made up of broken spheres and angular glass fragments (Heiken et al. 1974, Heiken and McKay 1974). None of the glass in this sample is similar to lunar agglutinates, nor contains broken mineral or lithic fragments characteristic of impact glass. The average grain size of 74220 is ~ 40 microns (figure 3). The orange soil samples (as measured by the Is/FeO parameter) are extremely immature (Morris 1978, Morris and Gose 1977). Thus, this soil is not like that of other lunar soils and is interpreted as a pyroclastic deposit (Heiken et al. 1974).

petrography of the core (74002, 74001) is described in McKay et al. (1978). The core varies in its ratio of orange glass to devitrified black glass. Many beads are broken, presumably by the impact that made Shorty Crater. Few glass beads have vesicles (figure 5).

The devitrification features of the orange and black glass spheres in 74220 and 74001 are described by Haggerty (1974), Arndt and Engelhardt (1987) and Heiken and McKay (1978). Quench crystals of olivine and ilmenite (figures 4 and 6) make devitrified orange

glass appear opaque (black). These black glass droplets are found to have the same chemical composition as the orange glass (Heiken and McKay 1974). Olivine composition is Fo (Prinz et al. 1973, Taylor and 68-82 Carter 1974 and Heiken et al. 1974).

The grey samples collected from the ends of the trench (74240 and 74260) also contain ropy glasses of presumed impact origin (Fruland et al. 1977, Korotev and Kremser 1992) as well as a variety of breccias and basalts.

The surfaces of the orange glass spheres are found to have a unique coating of micromounds (100 to 1000 ìm) (Heiken et al. 1974, Meyer et al. 1975, Clanton et al. 1978). In some places the coating has been scraped off (figure 7). The coatings were found to be made of mixed salts, with ZnS as a main component (figue 8). Very few micrometeorite craters were found on the surfaces of the spheres.

## **Surface-correlated volatiles**

Tatsumoto et al. (1973) was the first to notice that the 74220 contained surface-correlated volatiles (Pb). Gibson and Moore (1973a,b) noted that 74220 was unusual as a lunar soil in that it gave off SO2 at a low temperature (figure 13). By analyzing different size fractions, Thode and Rees (1976) showed that the sulfur was enriched on the surfaces of the grains, but they found that 34S remained constant over different size fraction (unlike the case for all other lunar soils). Jovanovic et al. (1973) found that 74220 was enriched in Cl and Te and suggested that the source of high halogens was "fumarolic activity". Jovanovic and Reed (1974) and Wanke et al. (1973) found 74220 to be enriched in halogens (table 6) and Goldberg et al. (1976) showed the F to be a surface deposit (figure 9).

Meyer et al. (1975) and Wasson et al. (1976) hypothesized that halogens were in the vapor of the lava fountain, because of the increased volatility of various metals as chlorides and because some Cl and F was found on the surface of the glass. Cirlin and Housley (1977) used a technique that involved HF treatment to enhance thermal release of Pb, to show that the Pb was indeed present as PbCl2 on the surface of the orange glass. Bell et al. (1974) reported evidence of FeCl2 .

Reed et al. (1977) and others have carefully studied the behavior of Zn, Pb and other elements during various kinds of leaching and conclude that although

these elements are present in surface coating, they are not easily released. Krahenbuhl (1980) showed convincingly that Zn, Hg, Ge, Au and Ir were on the surfaces of the particles by carefully analyzing different grain sizes of the core tube 74002/1. Eugster et al. (1981) also showed that Br, and I were "anti-correlated" with grain size and thus on the surfaces of the glass beads. Meyer et al. (1975) used the ion microprobe to show that Zn, Cu, Ga, Pb and other elements were on the surfaces of glass beads from 74220. (figure 8). Butler and Meyer (1976) showed that the prevalent coating material (micromounds) contained sulfur. Nearly everyone agrees that the volatile element deposit on the glass beads was due to condensation of gas from volcanic eruption (figure 12).

# **Double Drive Tube 74002 – 74001**

A 67 cm long double drive tube was collected from close to the trench at Shorty Crater. Nagel (1978), McKay et al. (1978), Morris et al. (1978), Bogard and Hirsch (1978), Blanchard and Budahn (1978), Crozaz (1978) and Heiken and McKay (1978) studied the double drive tube. Eugster et al. (1979, 1980, 1981) determined the age and exposure history of this important sample. Clanton et al. (1978) and Cirlin et al. (1979) studied the surface coatings on the particles.

## **Chemistry**

There are at least three important, variable, chemical components to consider in understanding the orange soil (endogenous volcanic melt, volcanic exhalation,

![](_page_4_Figure_7.jpeg)

*Figure 11: Normalized rare-earth-element pattern for composite of orange glass spheres from 74220 (data from Philpotts et al. 1974).* 

and meteoritic contamination). The volcanic exhalation is seemingly coupled to the endogenous component in time (Tera and Wasserburg 1976). Morgan and Wandless (1979) used volatile and siderophile element data from the core tube to unravel the contributions from meteorites and volcanic exhalations. Recently, Walker et al. (2004) have shown that the highlysiderophile-elements (namely Os) are greatly depleted in the orange glass.

Table 1 and figure 11 give the chemical composition of the bulk samples. Portions of the orange soil (74220) and the core (74002/1) are relatively uncontaminated by lunar regolith, and closely match the composition of the glass beads. However, in the bulk trench samples (74240 and 74260) and the top 5 cm of the core (74002), there is also a variable amount of mixing (by gardening) with lunar regolith.

Numerous investigators analyzed a large number of orange and black glass beads from Apollo 17 (table 5). Delano and Lindsey (1983) and Delano (1986) have identified several (~25) groups of volcanic glass, but found that the orange glass from 74220 was very constant in composition (figure 10). Hughes et al. (1990) analyzed some of the individual glass particles for a long list of elements (table 2).

Delano (1986) found that mafic volcanic glasses always have relatively high Ni, so Ni, at least, is not an indicator of meteoritic contamination in these samples.

The special feature of the orange glass samples is that they are found to be enriched in Zn, Cu, Ag, Cd, Tl, Br (and other metal halides) when compared to other lunar

samples (Morgan et al. 1974, Duncan et al. 1974) and this has been much discussed (see section of surfacecorrelated volatiles). Table 6 tabulates some of the analytical results for halogens and sulfur in the orange glass samples. While sulfur is not high in the bulk sample, it is an important component in the surface deposits (see Butler and Meyer 1976).

Various investigators (Walker et al. 2004, Krahenbuhl 1980, Wasson et al. 1976) have etched or leached the surfaces of the glass beads in an effort to separate the components (figure 14).

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Husain and Schaeffer (1973), Huneke et al. (1973), Eberhardt et al. (1975), Alexander et al. (1978) and Huneke (1978) determined the age of the orange glass spheres by 39Ar-40Ar plateau (figures 15, 16 and table). In a "tour-de-force", Huneke dated individual glass beads at about 3.6 b.y. (figure 18). Tera and Wasserburg (1976) used the lead isotopes leached from the surface, along with the residue, to date the age of formation of the orange soil (figure 17). U, Th and Pd data for 74220, 74240, 74260 and 74001 are also given in Nunes et al. (1974), Silver (1974) and Tatsumoto et al. (1987). They note that 204Pb is relatively high and easily released by mild thermal heating, or leaching.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Keith et al. (1974), Fruchter et al. (1978) and Murrell et al. (1979) determined the radioactivity of 74220 and 74002/1, due to cosmic ray interaction (table 4). Based on 22Na, 26Al activity, Fruchter et al. (1978) found that the top 2-3 cm of the core has been actively mixed with mare components (gardened) and about 2 cm of soil might be missing from the top of the core. Murrell et al. (1979) found the top of the core was undersaturated in 53Mn.

Kirsten et al. (1973), Fleischer and Hart (1974), Hutcheon et al. (1974) and Crozaz (1978) reported nuclear track ages for orange soil samples (~ 10 m.y.).

Kirsten et al. (1973), Schaeffer and Husain (1973) and Hintenberger et al. (1974) reported the exposure age of 74220 as 30 m.y., 32 m.y. and 27 m.y., respectively. However, Bogard and Hirsch (1978) found that the data for the nearby core required a two-stage cosmic-ray exposure – 20 m.y. initially, followed by 10 m.y. (the presumed age of Shorty Crater). Eugster et al. (1977 and 1981) offer a different irradiation model based on an age of ~17 m.y. for Shorty Crater. The sample may have also been irradiated for up to 35 m.y., right after it erupted !

Another interesting discovery was that the Apollo 17 orange soil sample is unique among all lunar soils, in that it shows no surface 18O, 30Si or 34S enrichment, which means it could not have been exposed to the lunar surface for any length of time (Taylor and Epstein 1974, Thode and Rees 1976).

## **Processing**

The location of the trench and core tube on the rim of Shorty Crater are discussed in Muehlberger et al. (1973) and Wolf et al. (1981) (figure 20 and 21) and the samples were described in Apollo 17 PET (1973).

Only a portion of 74220 was sieved. In the sieving that was done, there were some orange glass clods that were found, but these remain unstudied. There also remain unsieved portions of 74240 and 74260 (figure 22).

Various investigators (e.g. Krahenbuhl 1980) sieved the samples to obtain results on different size fractions.
