### **Introduction**

"The Luna 20 core, weighing 50 grams exhibited no stratification when placed on a tray. The soil was light gray and has a median grain size of about 70 microns. The sample allocated to NASA was 2.036 g from the 19 to 27 cm level of the sample tray (from certificate). The sample was sieved by the NASA Curator into the

following fractions: greater than 500 microns, 0.192 g; 250 – 500 microns, 0.183 g; 125 – 250 microns, 0.235 g; and fines less than 250 microns, 1.426 g." (from Heiken and McEwen 1972). *(that is not the depth in the core, but rather the position on the extrusion tray)* 

The geologic setting for Luna 20 is outlined in Heiken and McEwen (1972) and Florensky et al. (1979)(*in Cyrillic*). The landing site was in the lunar "highlands" about 160 km north of the Luna 16 site, and about 33 km from the contact with the "shoreline" of Mare Fecunditatis. "The complexly faulted terrain at this site has probably been involved in many generations of shattering and uplift produced by impacts which formed the large basin ring structures"(Heiken and McEwen (1972).

Although Luna 20 collected samples from the "lunar highlands", they were not as anorthositic as might be expected. The largest component is made of impact breccias. The Luna 20 soil also contains more ironrich pyroxene, than other highland soils (Simon et al. 1981). This may be due to the relative close proximity of mare basalt (33 km).

### **Petrography**

The Luna 20 soil sample contains crystalline lithic fragments of mare basalt, the anorthosite-noritetroctolite group and feldspathic basalt (Crawford and

Weigand 1973, Taylor et al. 1973, Cameron et al. 1973, Kridelbaugh and Weill 1973, Prinz et al. 1973, Tarazov et al. 1973 and others). Mineral and glass fragments in the soil and microbreccias are consistent with their origin from comminution of the crystalline lithic fragments. Simon et al. (1981) give the mode.

Albee et al. (1973), Laul and Schmitt (1973) and Podosek et al. (1973) studied two small fragments (22006, and 22007, ) that they termed "metaigneous". From what is now known, these are probably impact melt rocks. The carefully planned work on small lunar rock fragments showed how much can be learned from a coordinated study. The age is shown in figure 11,

the pyroxene composition is in figure 5b and the chemical composition is given in table 2.

Swindle et al. (1991) studied 6 additional fragments (table 2) and were able to get an age for one of them (figure 12).

# **Mineralogy**

There is an abundance of iron-rich pyroxene in Luna 20 samples, which must mean there is a large component of mare material (figure 5). There is also some Mg-rich pyroxene form true highland rocks. The plagioclase form Luna 20 is very calcic (Steele and Smith 1973, bell and Mao 1973).

Brett et al. (1973), Haggerty (1973), Goldstein and Blau (1973) and others studied the opaque minerals. Glass (1973), Warner et al. (1973), Meyer (1978) and Simon

et al. (1981) determined the composition of numerous glass particles (figures 6 and 7). There are some glass particles from mare regions. A major cluster at about 26% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> has the same average composition as for other sites and is termed "highland basalt" (which may be a misnomer).

#### **Chemistry**

Bansal et al. (1973), Vinogradov (1973), Nava et al. (1973), Philpotts et al. (1972), Morgan et al. (1973), Laul et al. (1973, 1981) and others reported analyses of the Luna 20 core from different depths – finding it relatively uniform (table 1). The overall trace element content of the soil was lower than for other missions (figure 8).

Laul and Schmitt (1973), Helmke et al. (1973), Vinogradov (1973) and Swindle et al. (1991) analyzed several small fragments (tables 2 and 3). Laul et al.

(1981) analyzed the different grain size fractions, finding that the finest fraction (<10 microns) had the highest content of trace elements, as is the case for other lunar soils.

Simoneit et al. (1973) reported 380 ppm carbon and 80 ppm nitrogen in soil sample 22001,3.

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Podosek et al. (1972) obtained precise ages for two impact melt rocklets from Luna 20 by the Ar/Ar plateau technique (figure 11). Swindle et al. (1991) also obtained a precise age of another (figure 12). Turner et al. (1973) could not get a well defined age on the very small fragments they studied (4.0 ± 0.3 b.y.). However, Andersen and Hinthorne (1973) reported older ages for a phosphate and a "Y,Zr phase" by the ion probe Pb/Pb method.

Tatsumoto (1973), Tera and Wasserburg (1973), studied the U-Th-Pb systematic finding excess Pb (unsupported by U, Th) in these Luna 20 samples. Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1973) and Nyquist et al. (1973) reported Rb-Sr results.

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Turner et al. (1973) reported an exposure age for L2015 of 340 m.y. from 38Ar measurements. Heymann et al. (1973) reported 21Ne exposure ages of 260 m.y. and 38Ar ages of 200-600 m.y. for the Luna 20 soil while Podosek et al. (1973) reported 900 – 1300 m.y. exposure ages by 38Ar for the two metaigneous particles they studied from the soil. This is understood as due to volatile release of comminuted soil over time.

### **Other Studies**

Clayton (1973) and Taylor and Epstein (1973) determined the isotopic composition of oxygen.

Rare gas analyses were reported by Agrawal et al. (1974), Eugster et al. (1975), Heymann et al. (1973)

Nuclear tracks produced by cosmic rays were studied by Crozaz et al. (1973), Berdot et al. (1972), Phakey and Price (1973) and Russian investigators (figure 13).

### **Processing**

After the sample was returned to Earth (Moscow), it was transferred into a chamber filled with He at the Vernadsky Institute (see figure in Vinogradov 1973) where the Luna 20 core was extruded into a tray, which was divided into zones (figure 14). The details of initial sample processing are given in Surkov 1979, *in Cyrillic*). The depth of the sample in the core does not correspond to the marking on the tray, but the relative position was maintained.

The USSR Academy of Science made samples available to the international science community. The US sample, L2009, from 19-27 cm (2.036 grams), was traded for Apollo core material.

L2015 (0.51 g) was allocated to the Royal Society of London and was from the 27-32 cm zone (Turner et al. 1973). The French CNES also got ~1 gram from 19-23 cm zone (L-2010).

India and Czechoslovakia studied splits from several depths (figure 14)..
