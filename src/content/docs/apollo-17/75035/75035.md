LMP Here I am in the middle of a boulder field. The texture appears to be subophitic to – sort of like a diabase, although a little coarser. But it's unquestionably organized with that variation in vesicle concentration. I have the impression that these blocks are buried up here. That the mantle does exist, even on Camelot. There are a few blocks that look like they're lying more or less on the surface, you can attribute those to craters that have disrupted the block field. The big ones seem to be projecting out of the mantle.

CC Do you see any such mantle - - on top of them.

LMP No, I don't. What's there seems to be what could have been knocked up there. But I don't have the impression of draping, so much as I have just burial. And I have a feeling that the zap-pitting process just has cleaned these boulders off – of anything that may have been on top of them, in excess of what's around them, right now.

LMP That looks like our old friend, the gabbro, all right. 75015 is Gene's fairly freshly fractured rock.

CDR Here's another right here. 75035 is another of the same variety. Wish we'd started on that structured rock because we're going to run out of time. Let's go over there and get a least one off of it.

CDR These rocks here have a much greater density of the white mineral in them, or crystals, that I've ever seen before, Jack. Where did we see these kind before?

that's been thrown up there rather than – this rock is about 3 meters in diameter but it only stands about – at the most – one-third of a meter high. But we can get up about a meter from the soil/rock interface and get some soil off the rock, I think (75060-5). It's about a centimeter deep and a half meter in.

CDR Let's take that chip there that's lying on top with the next scoop. That's the soil from the top of the rock. And we're taking piece of the rock itself, which looks pretty much like the other one. It might be a little bit more vesicular (75075).

LMP Let me get over here and try to get one bag of soil that's away from the boulder.

CDR I'm sampling down to about 5 centimeters (75080-5).

### **ntroduction**

Lunar sample 75035 was collected from a small boulder on the rim of Camelot Crater (figure 4) and is presumed to represent a portion of a lava flow, deep beneath the regolith (Wolfe et al. 1981). This sample, along with 75015 and 75055 from the same location, is slightly more aluminous and less titanium rich, than other Apollo 17 basalts (Rhodes et al. 1976), and is surprisingly similar to some of the Apollo 11 basalts. It has the highest sulfur content (0.3 %) of any lunar sample.

The flat side of 75035 is pitted with micrometeorite craters and also shows about 2-3 % vugs or vesicles (figure ). Zap pit are also found on the S, E and W sides. Surface photography allowed accurate orientation.

75035 has been dated at 3.76 b.y. with an ~80 m.y. exposure to cosmic rays.

### **Petrography**

Longhi et al. (1974) found that 75035 was texturally and chemically like some of the Apollo 11 basalts (see also 75055). It is a medium-grained subophitic high-Ti basalt texturally similar to the Apollo 11 ophitic basalts (figure 2). Suhedral laths of plagioclase are surrounded by clumps of anhedral pyroxene. Large laths of ilmenite penetrate the plagioclase and pyroxene, providing evidence that ilmenite was the first phase to crystallize from the melt.

Meyer and Boctor (1974) studied the minor phase in 75035 and Roedder and Weiblen (1975) studied melt inclusions in ilmenite from 75035. Metallic iron appears to have crystallized from the melt as a minor phase throughout the crystallization sequence.

Shih et al. (1975) and Rhodes et al. (1976) discuss the origin and differentiation of Apollo 17 basalts. 75035 appears to be the result of low pressure mineral separation and elemental fractionation of a more mafic parental magma.

## **Mineralogy**

*Pyroxene:* Pyroxene crystals in 75035 are highly zoned. The composition of early formed pyroxene (Wo40En43Fs15) varies continuously to pyroxferroite (figure 6). Some pyroxene crystals are sector-zoned. Jagodzinski et al. (1975) reported pigeonite exsolution from the augite cores.

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase (An88-72) grains up to 1.5 mm show iron enrichment during crystallization (Longhi et al. 1974).

*Ilmenite:* Ilmenite laths as big as plagioclase are abundant in 75035 (Meyer and Boctor 1974).

*Cristoballite:* 75035 has about 5% silica as a residual phase in the intersticies.

*Metallic Iron:* Meyer and Boctor (1974) found that metallic iron was associated with several accessory phases, and reported Ni and Co contents (figure 7). Iron grains were often associated with ulvospinel.

*Figure 10: Composition of Apollo 17 basalts with 75035.* 

Taylor and Williams (1974) reported ~1 % Co, but no Ni in iron grains.

*Troilite:* Meyer and Boctor (1974) determined the Ti content of troilite (but this is likely secondary flourescence)!

*Tranquillityite:* Careful analysis reported in Meyer and Boctor (1974) (Table 2).

*Baddeleyite:* Careful analysis reported in Meyer and Boctor (1974).

*Zirconolite:* Careful analysis reported in Meyer and Boctor (1974).

### **Chemistry**

Papike et al. (1976) termed 75035 and 75055 as low-K Apollo 17 basalts. Note that these samples also have

lower Ti content and are nearly identical in composition to Apollo 11 basalts (figures 8 and 9). Analyses include those by Laul et al. (1974), Wanke et al. (1975), Brunfeldt et al. (1974), Rose et al. (1975) and Duncan et al. (1976)(table 1). Paces et al. (1991) classify 75035 as a type A, Apollo 17 basalt (figure 10).

### **Summary of Age Data for 75035**

Pb/Pb Rb/Sr Ar/Ar Nunes et al. 1974 3.56 ± 0.4 b.y. Murthy and Coscio 1976 3.81 ± 0.14 Turner and Cadogen 1974 3.76 ± 0.05

**Caution: Be cautious of old decay constants.** 

![](_page_6_Figure_8.jpeg)

*Figure 13: Pb/Pb age for 75035 (from Nunes et al. 1974).* 

Moore et al. (1974), Petrowski et al. (1974), Gibson and Moore (1974), Gibson et al. (1975), Moore (1975), Moore and Lewis (1976), Des Marias (1978) and Gibson et al. (1976) reported carbon, sulfur and nitrogen abundances. The sulfur content of 75035 (2770 ppm) is the highest recorded for any lunar sample (Gibson et al. 1976). Merlivat et al. (1974) determined the water content and isotopic ratio of hydrogen.

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Murthy and Coscio (1976), Nunes et al. (1974), Turner et al. (1973) and Turner and Cadogen (1974) have each dated 75035 (figure 11-13). With an age of about 3.8 b.y., it is apparently one of the oldest mare basalts – nearly as old as the Serenitatis Basin.

Tera and Wasserburg (1974) discuss the U/Pb age of 75035 and 75055 – giving an intercept age age of 4.42 b.y. (age of source region ?).

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Turner and Cadogen (1974) reported a cosmic ray exposure age of 80 m.y. determined by 38Ar. Crozaz et al. (1974) and Arvidson et al. (1976) reported a cosmic ray exposure age of 75035 of 72 ± 2 m.y. by the 81Kr method. Marti et al. (quoted by Bhandari et al. 1977) determined 89 ± 3 m.y. by 81Kr. This gives the apparent age of Camelot Crater.

Crozaz et al. (1974) and Bhandari et al. (1977) reported a track ages of 7.3 m.y. and 5.4 m.y. respectively. These are understood to be low because of the constant erosion of the rock surface by micrometeorite bombardment. Based on their study of the incidence angle of fossil cosmic ray tracks in plagioclase, Kratschmer and Genter (1976), determined that 75035 probably had a "complex burial history".

Yokoyama et al. (1974) determined that the surface of 75035 was "saturated" in  $^{26}$ Al = 107 dpm/kg. ( $^{22}$ Na = 170 dpm/kg.)

#### Other Studies

The results obtained on 75035 are reviewed in the catalog by Neal and Taylor (1993).

Crozaz et al. (1974) determined the isotopic ratios of Xe and Kr.

Lugmair and Marti (1978) presented Sm and Nd isotope data in a diagram.

Turner and Cadogen (1974) used 75035 to evaluate the role of Ar recoil effects that might effect age dating plagioclase. Schaeffer et al. (1977) used 75035 to try to understand how a laser probe might be used to date an igneous rock of known age (they obtained a range

of ages). Schaeffer et al. showed that Ar recoil effects are often confused with diffusion loss of Ar from high K phases. Note: Horn et al. (1975) used 75075 to investigate the effects of recoil on Ar/Ar ages.

Pearce et al. (1974), Brecher (1977) and Sigiura et al. (1979) determined the magnetic properties of 75035.

Longhi et al. (1974) and O'Hara and Humphries (1975) determined the low pressure phase diagram for Apollo 17 basalts, including 75035. Taylor and Williams (1974) and Usselman et al. (1975) determined the cooling rate of the sample. McCallum and Charette (1977, 1978) determined the crystal/liquid distribution coefficients of Zr and Nb for ilmenite, armalcolite and

Petrowski et al. (1974) and Gibson et al. (1975) determined the isotopic composition of carbon and sulfur in 75035.

### **Processing**

In 1973, 75035 was sawn to create a slab (figures 14 and 15). However, the orientation of the columns cut from this slab do not appear to be normal to the lunar surface orientation (beware!).

75035 is used for public display, including a small piece for the Astronaut Ambassador Program.
