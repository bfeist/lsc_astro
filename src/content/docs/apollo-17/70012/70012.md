### **Introduction**

Lunar core 70012 "was hand driven to a hard layer at 28 cm depth 0.5 m inside the plus-Y footpad of the LM (figure 1). The site lies on regolith developed on basaltic subfloor, near the center of the Valley, approximately 750 m equidistant between the large (300 to 400 m) craters Camelot and Sherlock. The sample was collected in a relatively flat area with common, but subdued 10- to 30 cm diameter craters. Most of the surface appeared fine grained with particles near the limit of resolution of the surface photographs, but 1 to 2 percent of the surface was covered with particles as much as 3 or 4 cm in diameter. Similar material is in the core. Although this core was not

disturbed by footprints, the top 1 or 2 cm were probably depleted in fine soil by the LM descent propulsion engine."

"When the buddy secondary life-support system bag was opened in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory, the bottom cap of the core was off and lying nearby, and the soil was spilling from the bottom. Forty-seven grams of slumped material were excavated from the base of the core to provide a fresh vertical face, which was the supported by a plug of aluminum foil. The upper follower was in place, and the X-ray indicated

no serious cracking or slumping in the remainder of the core (figure 2)."

"The excavated material was mostly fines, with 10 % being fragments of medium- to coarse- grained vesicular basalt as much as 11 mm in diameter. Although this samples is petrographically similar to the upper bed of 70008, it is finer- grained. None of the breccias fragments or coarse-grained frameworktextured soil of the deep drill string appear in this core, however, the hard layer which prevented further penetration, could be the coarse-grained deposit."

## **Processing**

*A footnote in table 8 in Mitchell et al. (1973), mentions that 114 cm3 of material may have fallen out of the bottom of 70012 into the bag, because of a loose cap!*
