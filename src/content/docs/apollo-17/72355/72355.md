# **Introduction**

72355 was collected from the side of boulder #2 at station 2 on the landslide off of the South massif (figure 1). It proved to be the same material as 72395 and the other samples of this boulder (i.e. impact melt breccia). (see transcript for this boulder under 72335)

# **Petrography**

Dymek et al. (1976) and Ryder (1993) found tha the texture and mineralogy of this sample was the same as for 72315 and 72395. The exterior surface has a thick patina, with prominent zap pits (figure 2). The interior (figure 7) reveals about 5 % vugs and void space. There are no prominant lithic clasts.

# **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* The compositon of olivine grains is tightly grouped at Fo70±2.

*Pink Spinel:* Pink spinel grains are Mg- and Al-rich in the center and zone to more Cr-rich at the edge.

*Pyroxene:* The composition of pyroxene is depicted in figure 5.

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase in 72315 often has undulatory extinction, and is sometimes feathery (maskelynite devitrification). Large grains have overgrowth rims with olivine "necklaces". Plagioclase ranges in composition from Or0.2Ab2 An98 to about Or3 Ab22An75 (Dymek et al. 1976).

*Ilmenite:* Ilmenite in 72355 is evenly dispersed in the matrix, has a seive-like texture and is Mg-rich.

*Metallic Iron:* Metallic iron is meteoritic in origin (see figure 7 in section on 72395).

# **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of 72355 is found to be identical to that of other samples of this boulder (see 73215).

# **Radiogenic age dating**

The age of 72355 is ~ 3.9 b.y. as measured for 72395. Tera et al. (1974) determined a Rb-Sr model age of 4.38 b.y.

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Keith et al. (1974) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 26Al = 84 dpm/kg., 22Na = 87 dpm/kg, 54Mn = 66 dpm/kg, 56Co = 58 dpm/kg and 48V = 12 dpm/kg.

# **Processing**

Boulder 2 was a "Wasserburg consortium". Ryder (1993) included this sample in his catalog. In 2004 is was broken in half to get a fresh sample (figure 8).
