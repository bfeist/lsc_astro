# **Introduction**

79195 is a weakly lithified polymict breccia with a large clast of mare basalt (figure 1). It has not been studied.

# **Petrography**

Neal and Taylor (1993) included 79195 in their catalog of mare samples. They reported that it was 75-80% matrix, with minor basalt clasts and minerals from basalts. Presumably that means is has very little highland material.

# *Significant clast*

Large basalt clast

# **Chemistry**

Randy Korotev has been allocated this sample for analysis.

# **Processing**

There are 5 thin sections of 79175.
