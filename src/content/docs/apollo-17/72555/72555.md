## **Introduction**

These three small rock fragments were collected by rake near the station 2 boulder, Apollo 17 – see section on 72501. As such, they are precious materials from the landslide off of South Massif (Wolfe et al. 1981).

## **Petrography**

Keil et al. (1974) and Ryder (1993) give very brief descriptions. The fragments are coherent, light colored, with minor numbers of vugs. Ryder states that they are similar to green-grey breccias (72548 -72549), otherwise known to be impact melt breccias. There are no thin sections and they have never been studied.
