#### Introduction

72435 is a very fine-grained, clast-bearing impact melt with a micropoikilitic texture (typical of breccias from the large impact craters). The small boulder from which this sample was chipped is illustrated in the section on 72415. The sample was returned in two pieces, which could be fit together (figure 1).

Clasts up to 1 cm in size are visible in the sample (figure 2), while larger clasts are abundant in the boulder (e.g. 72415). The matrix contains about 1 % vesicles – often aligned (figure 3). Geochronology experiments found that the clasts were not in isotopic equilibration with the matrix.

The research conducted on 72435 is reviewed in Ryder (1992). Most of the petrography has been reported by Dymek et al. (1976). In spite of this documentation, the data collected on the various clasts is difficult to correlate with the petrography and/or clasts seen in photos.

# **Petrography**

Sample 72435 is comprised of 5-10 % clasts (1 mm to 2 cm) set in an extremely fine-grained, partially-clastic, crystalline matrix (Dymek et al. 1976). The average grain size of the matrix is less than 50 microns with a micropoikilitic texture of intergrown pyroxene oikocyrsts and lath-like plagioclase and ilmenite (figure 5). Olivine and ilmenite occur around the rims of the pyroxene oikocrysts.

Dymek et al. (1976) studied the small clasts in 13 thin sections of 72435. Of special interest were two pinkspinel-bearing, troctolite clasts, one of which also had a small grain of cordierite present. The mineral modes for these plagioclase-rich clasts are given in the table. They appear to be related to the suite of plutonic rocks known as ferroan anorthosites (figure 9). The data on these clasts is confusing. However, Herzberg (1978), Herzberg and Baker (1980) and Baker and Herzberg (1980) have derived the temperature-pressure relationship from the mineral chemistry.

#### **Significant Clasts**

#### Clast 1 Cordierite-spinel-bearing: 72435,8

Dymek et al. (1976) and Baker and Herzberg (1980) give the composition of a 30 micron-sized grain of cordierite (see table), Al-rich spinel (figure 8) and other minerals in this clast. Mineral compositions are: olivine (Fo<sub>73</sub>), orthopyroxene (En<sub>65-87</sub>Wo<sub>2</sub>Fs<sub>20-33</sub>). A few micron-sized grains of ilmenite are included.

# **Clast 2 Spinel-bearing:** 72435,30 and ,31 Dymek et al. (1976) describe this clast as "highly fiable". Baker and Herzberg (1980) give the mineral

data.

#### Clast A:

Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1975) excavated a "leucocratic igneous clast" with plagioclase ( $An_{95}$ ), pyroxene ( $En_{77}Wo_4Fs_{19}$  and  $En_{49}Wo_{39}Fs_{12}$ ) and olivine ( $Fo_{77}$ ).

#### Clast E: Plagioclase

Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1975) describe and analyzed this large clast (0.5 by 1.0 cm). It is mostly plagioclase ( $An_{92-87}$ ), but with minor olivine and some K-rich regions ( $An_{54}Ab_4Or_{42}$ ). This clast was dated by Rb-Sr (figure 12).

#### Granite (?):

Dymek et al. (1976) report small "aggregates of plagioclase, K-rich glass, SiO<sub>2</sub>, ilmenite, troilite and metal (and one zircon)".

#### **Mineralogy**

**Olivine:** Olivine oikocyrsts range from  $Fo_{70-72}$ . Small olivine clasts were zoned  $(Fo_{84-90})$ .

**Pyroxene:** The composition of pyroxene in 72435 is summarized in figure 6.

**Plagioclase:** Plagioclase chadocrysts (An<sub>85-91</sub>) are included in the pyroxene oikocrysts.

*Cordierite:* Dymek et al. (1976) and Baker and Herzberg (1980) give the composition of cordierite (see table).

**Spinel:** The composition of pink-spinel found in 72435 was determined by Baker and Herzberg (1980) (figure 8).

**Metal:** The composition of metallic iron in 72435 is given in figure 7. It is within the range of meteoritic iron, and not as Ni and Co rich as the iron in the dunite clast (72415) in same boulder.

**Footballs**: "Isolated footballs of troilite and iron metal up to 300 microns in size" were described in Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1976).

#### Chemistry

The chemical composition of 72435 is generally similar to that of many other breccia samples, including the large boulders at Apollo 17 (table 1 and figure 10). Murali et al. (1977) reported high Ir and Au.

# Radiogenic age dating

The matrix of 72435 proved difficult to date (Papanastassiou and Wasserburg 1975), because of intermixed small calcic plagioclase fragments (figure 11). This breccia has instead been dated by carefully dating the youngest clasts found within it (see table). Note: The plagioclase clasts labeled 1 and 2 by Huneke are not be the spinel-bearing clasts 1 and 2 of Dymek.

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

The exposure age of this boulder has not been reported. However, the surfaces of the samples are covered with zap pits and 72415 was saturated in 26Al, indicating that the boulder has been exposed in its location some time.

# **Other Studies**

Goswami et al. (1976) reported track data for 72435 and Pearce et al. (1974) reported the magnetic properties.

# **Processing**

72435 was studied by a consortium led by Gerry Wasserburg. A single saw cut was made through the largest piece of 72435 (figures 3 and 4) to produce a piece (,11) very like a slab. The careful dissection of 72435,11 is described in Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1975). Two large notches were take out of it (figure 14). There are 24 thin sections of 72435. Ryder (1993) gives a rather lengthy review.
