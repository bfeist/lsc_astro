#### **Introduction**

This core was taken adjacent to the trench were the orange soil 74220 was collected – see figure 1 in sections on 74220 and 74241. 74002 is the top section, and 74001 is the bottom. It took more than 28 hammer blows, and a lot of effort, to drive this double core into the orange-black soil (see transcript). Both the top and bottom sections were completely filled with material.

## **Transcript**

CC We'd like to get the double core here.

LMP Did you want it in the orange?

CC Rodger that. Affirm.

LMP Well, it's a vertical stratigraphy. Do you want to go sideways a little with it? Or do you just want to get it as deep as you can, huh?

CC Let's go as deep as we can in the orange.

CDR The bottom will be 44, and the top will be 35.

LMP You know that we just about got to the upper edge of this little ellipsoid zone. I think we've messed up most of it. Let's try right over here. The upper portion of the core is going to be a little bit disturbed, because we've walked around the area so much.

The density of the material in this core was greater than any other lunar core (Mitchell et al. 1973). The X-ray radiographs of the core showed very little structure (figure 3).

The material in 74002/1 has been exposed to cosmic rays for 17 m.y,, but also been previously exposed (for about 35 m.y.) much earlier in its history. There is the possibility that the 74002/1 is upside down compared with its original deposition (Heiken and McKay 1978).

CDR Take your picture. That's about a far as I could shove it in.

CC Was the gray mantle over the top of this, or was this showing all the way through to the surface.

LMP No, it was over the top. It was about a half a centimeter over the top. We're getting about 3 centimeters a whack.

CC Very good.

> CDR I'll tell you, it's a lot harder going in than that double core was back there. It's pretty hard.

> LMP It acts like it's inherently cohesive. It breaks up in angular fragments. An essential portion of the zone actually has a crimson hue, or red hue. Outside of that it's orange. And outside of that, it's gray.

> CDR I'm going up to the max here for just a minute or two. OK, let me hit some more. Ready?

> LMP Have at it. He's still getting a centimeter a whack, poor guy. I better get a locator.

> CDR The only thing I question is our ability to get it out. Man, That's really hit bottom. Pull slowly. Slowly so I can cap it all right. Let me get a cap. OK, vry slowly. Even the core tube is red! The bottom one's black – black and orange, and the top one's gray and orange!

> LMP The fact is, the bottom of the core is very black compared to anything we've seen.

> CDR Hey, we must have gone through the red soil because it's filled, but it's filled with back material. Dark gray, almost a very fine grained -

> LMP That might be magnetite. God, it is black isn't it? CDR Yes. Boy, it is black and is it contrasted to that orange stuff. Very black. We, not very black. It's a good dark gray. Very dark bluish gray. Why don't you take a picture of the hole, while you've got a camera there?

LMP Well the hole's mostly in shadow.

CDR The bottom of the upper core is also dark. And, like you might expect, the top of the bottom core is dark, too.

LMP If I ever saw a classic alteration halo around a volcanic crater, this is it. It's ellipsoidal. It appears to be zoned. There's one sample we didn't get. We didn't get the more yellow stuff, we got the center portion.

- - - LMP The lower core is chunky-jam full. I don't think we budged that thing. Hey, bob, thoise core didn't feel like the follower went down at all. Shouldn't it have gone a little bit?

CC Not necessarily, if it's pretty compact stuff. You were having a hard time getting it in.

LMP Well, I thought there was a little space up there, but maybe I just didn't feel it.

#### **Petrography**

The overall description of the Orange Soil samples from Shorty Crater is compiled in the sections for 74220 and 74241 – here I discuss the double drive tube in greater detail.

74002 was first opened and described in 1977 and 74001 was studied in 1981, although two grams of material from the bottom of the core were examined by the PET (LSPET 1973). The initial description was that the material from the bottom of the core was "unusually cohesive and consists of very dark to black opaque spheres and conchoidally fractured fragments".

Pieters et al. (1980) studied the variation in color of 74002 using multispectral (vidiocon) techniques to try to map the stratigraphy. However, it is hard to discern what was learned from this effort (see montage in their paper).

Cirlin et al. (1978) and McKay et al. (1978) found that most of the glass particles in the core were broken

fragments (figure 2). This can also be seen in the thin sections of the core. On average, about 20 % of the particles are whole, 7 % are chipped and 73 % are broken. The reason the core is black is because most of the glass is devitrified, with olivine needles coated with ilmenite (Haggerty 1974).

McKay et al. (1978) and Krahenbuhl (1980) studied the grain size distribution (figure 6) for several depth intervals *(be aware that sieving may not always have been complete, and could be the cause for variation).*  They make the point that this sample is, on average, finer than any other lunar soil studied by them. The average grain size along the entire depth of the core is only 40 ± 5 microns.

McKay et al. (1978) determined the modal mineralogy for the top 5 cm of the core. There were a few basalt fragments and a few agglutinates in the top (figure 5).

The glass in 74002/1 contains olivine phenocrysts Fo81. Only a few glass particles have vesicles.

Clanton et al. (1978), Butler and Meyer (1976) and Cirlin and Housley (1979) studied the surface coatings on glass beads from this core (verifying the conclusion of Meyer et al. 1975) that these were sublimates produced during fire fountaining.

#### **Chemistry**

Since the double drive tube was taken immediately adjacent to the Orange Soil sample 74220, one can assume that the composition is the same.

Blanchard and Budahn (1978) analyzed 13 layers along the double core 74002/1 and found the core to be uniform in composition, except, perhaps the top 2 centimeters, which were either gardened or disturbed. They also analyzed the fine fraction (0 – 20 microns), finding that it was enriched in Zn (302 ppm) and proving that it was surface correlated. Krahenbuhl (1980) analyzed four layers @12, 25, 38 and 55 cm for 7 different grain sizes, showing that Zn, Hg, Ge and Au were enriched in the finer fraction, proving that the volatile and chalcophile elements are on the surfaces (figures 10 and11). Morgan and Wandless

(1979) claimed they could tell what kind of meteorite caused the crater (which?).

Gibson and Andrawes (1978) determined the sulfur content along the core finding that it was evenly distributed at about 550 ppm Simple heating removed most of the sulfur, consistent with the idea that the sulfur is a surface coating. Cirlin et al. (1978) showed conclusively that Pb, Zn and Cd were surface deposits. Jovanovic and Reed (1979) reported Hg and Br.

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

The age of Shorty Crater is 17 m.y., based on exposure age of 74255. The age of the glass beads in the Orange Soil are 3.7 b.y. (Eberhardt et al. 1975) and or 3.66 b.y. (Saito and Alexander 1979). Eugster et al. (1979) also used a unique U – fission Xe dating technique to obtain n age of 3.7 b.y.

Nunes et al. (1974) reported data for U-Th-Pb, but no age can be ascertained from this.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Fruchter et al. (1978) determined the cosmic-rayinduced activity of 22Na and 26Al (figure 7). Murrell et

*Figure 11: Hg, Ge, Au and Ir as function of grain size (Krahenbuhl 1979).* 

al. (1979) and Nishiizumi et al. (1983) presented a profile for cosmic-ray-induced 53Mn (figure 8). Nishiizumi et al. found a best fit to the theoretical curve if ~ 4 g/cm2 was removed from the top.

### **Other Studies**

Eugster et al. (1977, 1978, 1979) and Bogard and Hirsch (1978) have studied the rare gas isotopes in the

double drive tube. Kerridge et al. (1991) studied the nitrogen isotopes.

Crozaz (1978, 1979) determined the fossil nuclear tracks as function of depth (figure 9).

#### **Processing**

Lunar photographs of the core were unsuccessful (a shame). The cores were X-rayed in 1974, again in 1976, extruded in 1977-1978 and described in newsletters # 13 and 16. Nagle (1978) summarized his findings in figure 12. Several large "clumps" were removed during dissection. Two complete sets of thin sections were prepared, but have never been described.

So what we have here is an important core that hasn't been properly described, nor analyzed, with an abundance of samples ready to study!
