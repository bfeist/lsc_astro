#### **Introduction**

A double drive tube was successfully collected at station 9, on the ejecta blanket of Van Serg Crater (figure 1). The location was about 70 m downslope from the rim (figure 2) and about 1 m from the trench sample (79220). 79002 is the upper section, 79001 the lower section of the core. The obvious stratigraphy seen in the trench is not duplicated in the core.

#### **Petrography**

The maturity index Is /FeO of the every 5 mm depth has been determined (figure 3). A very mature layer is found at 5 – 8 cm depth. Morris et al. (1989) found the Is /FeO to be ~ 40 in that zone, compared to a value of

~25 for the rest of the core. McKay et al. (1988) found higher agglutinate content (44 %) in that zone as well (figure 5).

There were three visually obvious transitions from light to dark at about 10, 30 and 35 cm depth, but only the first of these transitions correlates with the maturity index.

Graf (1993) plotted the grain size distribution for data obtained by McKay et al. (figure 6).

#### **Chemistry**

Morris et al. (1989) determined the composition of 133 splits along the entire length of 79002/1 (every 5 mm). The core was found to be quite homogeneous along its length (the average is given in table 1). The mature section at the top, and the bottom 5 cm may have slightly different composition, as noted by Morris et al., but they are not statistically significant. However, the core has not been analyzed for all elements.

For comparison, Korotev and Kremser (1992) give a more complete analysis for 79221 – collected only 1 meter away.

#### **Transcript**

CC We have had a change of heart here again, as usual. And we're going to drop station 10 now that we've hurried you so much, and we're going to get a double core here. And we'd like to get some football-size rocks while you're doing that. And then we're going to leave here and go back to the LM.

LMP You don't want a double core here. I don't think we can do it, Bob. It's too rocky.

CDR You don't think we'll get through that stuff you just trenched?

LMP Well, I'm afraid there are rocks all through it.

CDR Let's try it.

- - -

- -- LMP The first core was easy: the second one a little tougher: and then it got tough down at the end. There, I'm getting a picture of you. Okay. I got it.

CDR Core but it want to slide out. It's full. No rocks in it. It looks just like the same stuff we've been traveling through.

CDR It's very loose spoil, just any little movement and you'll lose some of it. The top rammed down – Oh, almost half way without any effort. The bottom rammed down about an inch.

#### **Other Studies**

Stone and Clayton (1989) determined the isotopic composition of nitrogen as function of release temperature (figure 7).

#### **Processing**

According to Mitchell et al. (1973), it took less than 19 hammer blows to drive the core. *A footnote in table 8 therein, mentions that 41 cm3 of material may have fallen out of the top of 79001 (a section in the middle)!* 

Duke and Nagle (1976) give a preliminary "description" of the X-ray image of the core (*there is no mention of a missing section).* 79002 (upper section) was not dissected until 1986 and described in newsletter 47. 79001 was dissected in 1987 and described in newsletter 49.

Three sets of thin sections were prepared from epoxyimpregnated residue (figure 8). A detailed petrological

study has not been performed on this core, presumably because the trench samples nearly were more interesting. Particles seen in figure 8 and those extracted during dissection have not been studied.
