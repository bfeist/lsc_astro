## **Introduction**

73218 is a coherent impact melt rock similar to 73216 and 73275 from the same location.

Schneider and Horz (1974) determined the size distribution of micrometeorite craters.

## **Petrography**

Ryder (1993) gives the only description. He recognized that it was an impact melt rock, because the fine grained matrix has needles of plagioclase that formed from a melt. However, before it was a melt it was a breccias, because there are relict small clasts of anorthosites and anorthositic breccias (figure 4 a, b).

## **Chemistry**

None, but probably feldspathic.

## **Processing**

A two gram piece was allocated to Wasserburg, but no data have been reported. There are three thin sections.
