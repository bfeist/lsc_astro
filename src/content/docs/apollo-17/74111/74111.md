### **Introduction**

This soil (?) was collected along with a very friable regolith breccia (74115) and undoubtedly contains a large portion of material abraded off of 74115-74119 (returned in same bag). It was collected at LRV-5 at a "pit crater" in the light mantle (see transcript).

### **Petrography**

Morris (1978) determined the maturity index (Is /FeO =31).

Fruland (1983) and Simon et al. (1990) studied the main breccia fragment.

Meyer (1973) cataloged the 4 – 10 mm coarse-fines and Warren et al. (1991) studied one of the light colored particles (table).

### **Chemistry**

Korotev and Kremser (1992) reported the composition of the fines.

Transcript

LMP Good gosh! Yes, that's what they call a pit crater. Can you swing a little bit and let me get that fragment crater – see that one on your left there?

CDR Got you pictures?

LMP Yes, I got them.

CDR A quick rover sample of a very, very fragmental crater. The ejecta is about 50-percent small angular fragments, much different than we have seen before in terms of the type of patterns.

LMP I couldn't tell whether that was just – it looked like that might have been a crater that had gotten through to bedrock. There might have been a high point, and it got down to bedrock. But I can't *(tell).* It's the most blocky-rimmed crater we've seen for a
