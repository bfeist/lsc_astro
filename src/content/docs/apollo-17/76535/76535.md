#### **Introduction**

Troctolite 76535 is without doubt the most interesting sample returned from the Moon! It is a colorful, pristine, coarse-grained, plutonic rock that has had a slow cooling history. It is very old and has not been damaged by shock events. 76535 was collected as part of a rake sample at Station 6. This sample has been widely distributed, but its origin is still debated.

Figure 1 shows the main mass of 76535 before processing. The sample is friable, separating easily at the grain boundaries. Closeup photos of small pieces show the granular texture of the olivine and plagioclase

(figure 2). White plagioclase grains (0.2 to 0.7 mm) are translucent to slightly milky, while lustrous olivine grains (0.2 to 0.3 mm) occur in clusters and are honeybrown in color. Plagioclase shows nice striations on flat cleavage surfaces.

### **Petrography**

Gooley et al. (1974) and Dymek et al. (1975) describe lunar sample 76535 as a coarse-grained, olivineplagioclase cumulate that shows evidence of extensive annealing and re-equilibration (figure 3). This rock has a granular polygonal texture with smooth, curved

grain boundaries and abundant 120 degree junctions resulting from the slow process of grain coarsening leading to a mineral fabric with minimum surface area. Stewart (1975) used the grain size of 76535 (2 to 3 mm) and various assumptions to calculate the interval of annealing (~108 y) in the temperature range 100 to 600 deg C. Steward termed this "Apollonian" metamorphism (*although the term did not stick*).

Figure 4 shows that 76535 may be considered as an end member of the Mg suite of lunar highland rocks.

Small patches of vermicular "symplectite" intergrowth of Cr-spinel+high-Ca pyroxene+/-low-Ca pyroxene are a unique feature of this rock and are generally found at grain boundaries between olivine and pyroxene (Gooley et al. 1974; Dymek et al. 1975; Bell et al. 1975). Gooley et al., Dymek et al. and Schwartz and McCallum (1999) have used to reaction relations of this mineral assemblage to calculate the depth of origin of this plutonic rock (~47 km).

Small patches of mesostasis (termed "mosaic assemblages") are found to contain minor minerals including: baddeleyite, low-Ca pyroxene, high-Ca pyroxene, apatite, "whitlockite", Cr-spinel, metal, K-Ba feldspar, and "pyrochlore" (Gooley et al. 1974; Dymek et al. 1975).

Oriented needles of Fe-Ni-Co metal are found in plagioclase (Bell et al. 1975).

Based on identical mineral chemistry, Warren et al. (1987) apparently found at least two additional pieces of troctolite similar to 76535 in the "coarse fines" from the soil samples (76504,12 and 76034,90).

### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Olivine is very homogeneous at Fo87.3 (Dymek et al. 1975; Bersch et al. 1991).

*Pyroxene:* Anhedral grains of orthopyroxene (Wo ) up to 3 mm occur interstitial to olivine 0.9En84.1Fs11.3 and plagioclase (Dymek et al. 1975). Figure 5 shows the composition of mafic minerals in 76535. Heavilon and Crozaz (1989) used the ion microprobe to determine the trace element content of pyroxene. Careful crystal structure refinement of single crystal X-ray study of orthopyroxene indicate closure temperature for cation ordering at about 550 deg C (Domeneghetti et al. 2001). Smyth (1975) also studied the crystal structure of opx from 76535.

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase is homogeneous at An96.2 (Dymek et al. 1975). White to translucent plagioclase grains show striations due to twinning (LSPET 1973; Phinney et al. 1974; Gooley 1974). Smyth (1986) performed crystal structure refinement of anorthite using plagioclase from 76535 to determine the position of the cations in the structure. Nord (1976) studied the inclusions found in plagioclase. The trace element content of plagioclase has been reported by Haskin et al. (1975), Hansen et al. (1979), Steele et al. (1980), and Heavilon and Crozaz (1989).

*Augite:* Small grains of augite are found in symplectite and mesostasis areas. Dymek et al. (1975) report Wo43.6En48.5Fs4.4

*Spinel:* Dymek et al. (1975) and Haggerty (1975) gives the composition of Cr-spinel, which is found intergrown with augite in symplectite.

*Baddelyite:* Relatively large grains of ZrO2 are present.

*Metal:* Gooley et al. (1974) and Ryder et al. (1980) report the composition of metal grains in 76535.

*Phosphate:* The composition of both apatite (F 2.95% and Cl 1.18%) and whitlockite (high REE) are given in Dymek et al. (1975).

*Troilite:* Small grains have been reported.

*Pyrochlore:* Reported by Dymek et al. (1975).

#### **Chemistry**

Rhodes et al. (1974), Haskin et al. (1974) and Wiesmann and Hubbard (1975) reported the bulk chemical composition of 76535 (table 1 and figure 6). Morgan et al. (1974) and Wolf et al. (1979) reported the trace siderophile and volatile elements.

Haskin et al. used the whole-rock composition and known distribution coefficients to calculate the probable parent liquid. They concluded that the rock may have had ~16% trapped liquid when it originally crystallized from the melt.

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

Heroic efforts have been made to age date troctolite 76535 and the data from different decay schemes seem to be at odds (see Summary). Most recently, Premo and Tatsumoto (1992) have carefully considered the age of 76535 and concluded that it was formed between 4.23 and 4.26 b.y. (figure 7).

The various age dating studies of troctolite 76535 may provide an interesting study in the preservation of radiogenic information through the coarse of major metamorphic change. Careful study of Rb-Sr, Sm-Nd, U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar systematics has yielded a broad range of apparent isotopic closure ages; 4.61 to 4.16 b.y. (see Summary). The Rb-Sr isochron (figure 8) is based on Rb-rich inclusions in olivine, whereas the Sm-Nd isochron (figure 9) is based on REE included in pyroxene, plagioclase and accessory phases, exclusive of olivine.

Domeneghetti et al. (2001) and Nord (1976) note that this apparent age discrepancy is consistent with what is known about cation ordering in orthopyroxene and subsolidus exsolution of inclusions found in plagioclase. The Rb-Sr isochron presumably dates the isolation of Rb-rich inclusions in olivine (?) and is apparently insensitive to the metamorphism that produced the texture of the rock, while the Sm-Nd, U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar ages involve lower temperature mineral phases that are more sensitive to subsequent metamorphism and closure to movement of radiogenic elements at a later time. The study of rare gases by Chaffee et al. (1981) also shows that the different minerals in 76535 have different, mineral-specific, isotopic closure ages.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Bogard et al. (1975), Crozaz et al. (1974) and Lugmair et al. (1976) reported cosmic ray exposure ages of 195 ± 10 m.y., 211 ± 7 m.y., and 233 ± 16 m.y., respectively.

Premo and Tatsumoto (1992) show a hint of a lower intercept age at 62 ± 32 m.y., suggesting Pb disturbance at the time of excavation.

Kieth et al. (1974) reported the cosmic ray induced activity of 76535.

#### **Other Studies**

Charette and Adams (1977) have recorded the spectral reflectance of 76535 (figure 10). Braddy et al. (1975) reported a fission track age of 4.07 b.y.

Hohenberg et al. (1980) and Chaffee et al. (1981) have carefully studied "excess" fission xenon and trapped solar wind noble gases in troctolite 76535 (figures 11, 12). Stepwise heating of separated olivine and plagioclase showed evidence for *in-situ* decay of <sup>244</sup>Pu leading to fission Xe ages of 4.50 b.y. and 4.25 b.y. respectively (consistent with Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd ages above).

## **Processing**

Two 2 gram pieces of 76535 were used by Rhodes et al. (1994) and Haskin et al. (1994) to obtain the chemical composition.

The sample is very friable and broke up during initial sawing. There are probably other pieces of this sample in the residue of the collection bag (76530).
