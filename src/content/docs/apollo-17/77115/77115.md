## **Introduction**

Sample 77115 was sampled as "blue-gray breccia" from the boulder at Station 7 on the North Massif, Taurus-Littrow, Apollo 17. It is a sample of the boulder matrix that incorporated the large white clast (77215). It contains obvious large lithic clasts, as seen in hand specimen (figure 1), and contains numerous small lithic and mineral clasts in the matrix. The texture and chemical composition are similar to that of the back dike (77075). Schmitt observed that the dike 77075 was continuous with 77115 and that these samples were closely related in origin.

Sample 77115 is a gray, vuggy, very fine-grained, fragment-laden, crystalline-matrix breccia containing abundant xenoliths (clasts). It consists of two parts: a gray, fine-grained matrix making up most of the rock, and a thin layer of brown granular matrix breccia (Minkin et al. 1978). Chao et al. (1975) stated that 77115 was "not a breccia in a normal sense, but is a crystalline rock, formed by crystallization of a fragment-laden melt". The probable origin of impact melt breccias has been explained by Simonds (1975) and Onorato et al. (1976).

This sample and others from the Station 7 boulder were studied by the International Consortium led by Ed Chao (see summary by Minkin et al. 1978). The results on 77115 were also summarized in the catalog by Meyer (1994).

## **Petrography**

The fine-grained matrix of 77115 consists largely of an interlocking network of anhedral and lath plagioclase surrounded by pyroxene in a micropoikilitic texture (figure 2). The pyroxene oikocrysts are approximately 25-30 microns and the matrix plagioclase is ~15 microns. Equant grains of olivine are scattered throughout the matrix. Clusters of

ilmenite platelets and other minerals are found in the mesostasis between pyroxene oikocrysts.

Chao et al. (1975) find that the clast population of 77115 is different from that of 77135 (which generally surrounds 77115). Chao et al. and Huebner et al. (1976) report diffusively-rimmed xenocrysts in 77115. Thornber and Huebner (1980) and Sanford and Huebner (1980) discuss cation diffusion and cooling rates for 77115. They use chemical gradients in olivine to calculate a cooling rate of 10-25 deg C/hr.

The texture of 77115, 77135 and 77075 dike material is similar to that of the samples of the large boulder at Station 6. These samples are interpreted as recrystallized melt breccia from a large basin impact (Serenitatis?).

## **Significant Clasts**

The "troctolite" clast in 77115,19 was analyzed by Winzer et al. (1974) and Warren and Kallemeyn (1993). It is unusual in that it has high REE (figure 8), yet plagioclase is  $An_{95}$ , olivine is  $Fo_{89}$  and pyroxene is  $Wo_2En_{88}Fs_{10}$  (figure 7). Warren and Kallymeyn also note that the Cr-spinel in this clast is "uncommonly Mg-rich."

Chao et al. (1975) discuss a brownish-gray lighology found as a thin veneer on the surface of 77115. This "clast" is apparently a recrystallized breccia with a bimodal grain-size, containing millimeter-size clasts of granulated clinopyroxene set in a matrix of smaller, slightly fractured yello-green olivine (Fo<sub>68</sub>) and colorless to light gray plagioclase. No composition is presented.

The obvious small dark clasts in 77115 (as seen in figure 1) apparently remain unstudied.

#### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* The composition of olivine is  $Fo_{66-72}$  (Chao et al. 1975). A precise analysis for olivine in 77115 can be found in Bersch et al. (1991).

**Pyroxene:** The composition of pyroxene in 77115 is given in figure 5. The fine scale exsolution in pyroxene in 77115 was studied by McGee et al. (1980).

**Plagioclase:** Chao et al. (1975) determined the composition of plagioclase in 77115. Matrix plagioclase is  $An_{85-88}$ . Hansen et al. (1979) report the trace element composition of plagioclase.

*Ilmenite:* Engelhardt (1979) studied the ilmenite.

#### **Chemistry**

Table 1 and figure 8 summarize the chemical composition of 77115. The composition of the matrix (without the mineral clasts) was also determined by broad beam electron probe analysis (Chao et al. 1975).

The "troctolite" clast (,19) has very high REE, while its mineral chemistry shows it to be a mafic sample (figure 7).

Table 2 summarizes the additional chemical data obtained during age dating experiments.

#### Radiogenic age dating

Stettler et al. (1978) have restudied the ages of 77115 and confirmed their results obtained in 1975 (figure 9). 77115 has a pronounced intermediate temperature plateau at  $3.90 \pm 0.03$  b.y., which is problematical, because this rock was observed to be continuous with the dike rock (77075), which has been dated as  $3.98 \pm 0.03$  by the same laboratory.

Nakamura et al. (1976) determined an imprecise "age" of  $3.75 \pm 0.2$  b.y by Rb-Sr (figure 10). Nunes et al. (1974) reported U-Th-Pb data.

## **Other Studies**

Cisowski et al. (1983) and Hale et al. (1978) have reported the magnetic properties of 77115.

Thornber and Huebner (1980) determined the phase relationships as function of crystallization temperature. Sanford and Huebner (1979) studied diffusion in olivine.

## **Processing**

77115 has been sawn (figure 4). The initial processing and distribution of 77115 and other samples from Station 7 boulder is summarized in Butler and Dealing (1974) and Minkin et al. (1978). There are 28 thin sections (figure 2).
