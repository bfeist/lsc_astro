LMP You want me to try and get my scoop under there? Probably won't fall out.

CDR OK. Get as many pieces as we can. I don't know how many are going to come out. This whole thing will come out in a minute.

LMP I'll watch it. I'll watch it. Got it?

CDR Move your arm up and down. OK. I got it in case we don't get another one. Hey, we're getting good at that.

LMP Yes. Can't hold that much longer.

CDR Let me get up on this – up here.

LMP Why don't we get a bag out. Let me put these in a bag.

CDR That's why I'm getting up here si I can get my balance. Bob, 556 is one of the light-colored inclusions in the blue-grey rock.

LMP It's chips. I think I lost that other one. That's good enough.

CDR I got it; I know where it is.

LMP That's all right. It's not a lot of sample, but it's representative, I think. It looks a lot like that sugary rock, I smaples yesterday, doesn't it?

CDR Yes, it's pretty easy to break up; it's really not very coherent at all.

LMP You know, I thought last night, Bob, that I should use the word aplitic for a texture that we saw in that inclusion yesterday of the South Massif.

# **Introduction**

Feldspathic sample 76235 was found as a large clast (0.8 m) in the station 6 boulder (figures 1 and 2). Actually it was collected as a group of samples (see list) that were carefully chipped from the large white clast in block 1, of the large boulder (Wolfe and others 1981). All of these chips were placed in the same bag and are found to be from a similar, sugar-textured, white rock (figure 3 – 7). A small chip from the bag (76230) was studied during preliminary investigation (LSPET73). Most pieces have some patina with micrometeorite pits.

These samples are of a homogeneous, fine-grained, metamorphosed impactite. Mineral compositions are uniform, but there is a relic clastic texture and the rock contains a high content of meteoritic siderophiles.

The age of 76235 is 3.93 b.y., which is about the same as the age of the boulder itself. The importance of feldspathic granulites is discussed in Warner et al. (1977). Similar clasts have been found in the breccias from the South Massif (Lindstrom and Lindstrom 1986) and among the coarse-fines from Apollo 11 (Simon et al. 1983).

# **Petrography**

This light-colored sample of dense, feldspathic, granulitic impactite appears to be unifrom in texture and homogeneous on a scale of 1 cm. Mineral compositions are uniform (plagioclase An<sub>95</sub>, pigeonite Wo<sub>4</sub>En<sub>74</sub>Fs<sub>22</sub> and olivine Fo<sub>73</sub>)(Simonds 1975). The equant feldspar have seriate grain-size distribution, ranging from 20 microns to 600 microns, but, according to Simonds (1975), lack the polygonal texture of well-annealed rock. Rounded mafic inclusions up to 30 microns occur in the larger feldspars.

Warner et al. (1977) described the texture of 76235 as poikiloblastic and suggest that rounded plagioclase regions about 1 mm across are "megacrysts of anorthosite". Warner et al. (1977), Lindstrom and Lindstrom (1986) and Cushing et al. (1999) group this sample with feldspathic granulitic impactites. Cushing et al. (1999) determined the temperature of metamorphism from careful analysis of pyroxene pairs (1099 deg C for 76230 and 1117 deg C for 76235).

#### **Mineralogy**

**Olivine:** Olivine in 76235 is uniform in composition  $(Fo_{73})$ .

Figure 10: Composition of pyroxene and plagioclase on diagram by James (1980).

**Pyroxene:** Poikilitic pyroxene in 76235 includes plagioclase and olivine inclusions. Simonds (1975), Phinney (1981) and Cushing et al. (1999) determined pyroxene composition (figure 9).

**Plagioclase:** Plagioclase in 76235 is very calcic (An<sub>94-</sub><sub>95</sub>). Necklaces of inclusions indicating overgrowth, are missing in this granulitic rock.

*Opaques:* Opaques include minute iron, trolite and chromite. Ilmenite only occurs as lamallae in chromite.

#### **Chemistry**

LSPET (1973), Hubbard et al. (1974) and Lindstrom and Lindstrom (1986) showed that the composition of 76235 was similar to the other lunar ganulites (figures 9 and 10). As is the case with other samples of this sort, 76235 has abundant meteorite siderophiles (Higuchi and Morgan 1975, Hertogen et al. 1977).

#### Radiogenic age dating

Cadogen and Turner (1976) dated two splits of 76235 (troctolite clast?) as  $3.93 \pm 0.06$  b.y. and  $3.95 \pm 0.06$  b.y. respectively (although the plateaus were not

entirely flat). This age is similar to the age of the surrounding breccia matrix. However, the Rb-Sr systematics of the boulder have not equilibrated with the clast (figure 13).

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Cadogen and Turner (1976) determined the cosmic ray expsoure age of 76235 as 16 m.y. by the 38Ar method.

# **Other Studies**

The magnetization of sample 76307 (same as 76235) has been studied by Gose et al. (1978).

Phinney (1981) reported rare gas analysis by Bogard et al. (unpublished).

# **Processing**

A breif summary of what is known about 76235 et al. is given in the Apollo 17 catalog by Meyer (1994). There are two thin sections of 76230 and four thin sections of 76235.
