Sample 76015 was chipped off of the top corner of micrometeorite bombardment and developed a thick Block 5 of the big boulder at Station 6 (Wolfe et al. patina from glass splashes on opposing, adjacent 1981). It is a sample of lithologic unit B of the big boulder surfaces. The deep vugs and good boulder and is similar in color (green-grey) and texture photographic documentation allow study of direction to 76215 spalled from the top of adjacent boulder half. of micrometeorite bombardment.

The crystallization age of 76015 is ~3.9 b.y. and it has been exposed to cosmic rays for ~17.5 m.y.

## **Petrography**

Sample 76015 is a very vesicular, crystallinematrix breccia with <0.1 mm to 5 cm long irregular vesicles that compose about 20% of the rock by volume (figures 1-4). Some of the vugs and cavities are quite large (figure 5).

Simonds (1975) describes the poikilitic matrix of 76015 as a continuous network of interlocking pigeonite oikocrysts enclosing tabular plagioclase (10-50 microns) and rounded olivine chadocrysts. Small amounts of small augite grains (20 mcirons) are found both within the pigeonite and between grains.

a) b) Both poikilitic ilmenite and armalcolite grains up to 200 microns long, with spinel and rutile lamellae, are concentrated between the pyroxene oikiocrysts (figure 3 and 6).

The modal mineralogy of the matrix is about 50% plagioclase, 40% low-Ca pyroxene, with minor amounts of olivine, high-Ca pyroxene, ilmenite, armalcolite and metallic iron. Mineral and lithic clasts make up about 5-15% of the rock (Simonds 1975). They are predominantly granoblastic or poikilitic in texture with 70-80% plagioclase and often appear partially "digested."

Blandford et al. (1974) studied the thick patina on 76015, finding that it is made of glass splashes.

*Figure 7: Pyroxene and olivine composition in matrix of 76015 and porous clast (Phinney 1981).* 

Wentworth et al. (1999) found the patina on 76015 was due to "space weathering".

Vugs in 76015 and 76215 contain euhedral crystals of troilite and metallic iron with crystal growth steps (Carter et al. 1975). Phinney (1981) reported that large apatite crystals are found to be doubly terminated and loosely adhering to cavity walls. Large beta-cristobalite crystals and wiry and dendritic metallic Cu are also reported in these cavities!

Spudis and Ryder (1981) summarize the arguments that this boulder is from the melt sheet or ejecta blanket from the Serenitatis impact event. Simonds et al. (1976) and Onorato et al. (1976) provide a comprehensive thermal model for the lithification of impact melt breccias based on their detailed study of the textures of samples from the station 6 big boulder.

## **Mineralogy**

*Pyroxene:* There is more low-Ca pyroxene than high-Ca pyroxene in 76015 (figure 7). Takeda et al. (1976) studied the crystal structure.

*Olivine:* Phinney (1981) reports that olivine in 76015 is Fo70.

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase in the matrix is An85, while clasts are An95.

*Metallic Iron:* Misra et al. (1976) found the Ni and Co composition of iron grains in 76015 and 76215 were of similar distribution (figure 8).

## **Significant Clasts**

#### *Large Porous Clast: ,42*

Simonds (1975) and Phinney (1981) describe a large (2 cm) porous basalt clast in 76015 with intersertal texture (figure 9). The composition of pyroxene in this clast is shown in figure 7b. There is no olivine and plagioclase is An80. Otherwise, this clast has not been studied as an entity.

## **Chemistry**

Rhodes et al. (1974), Hubbard et al. (1994) and Wiesmann and Hubbard (1975) found that four seperate splits of 76015 were similar to one another and to the matrix of the other samples of this big boulder (figure 10). Higuchi and Morgan (1975), Palme et al. (1978) and Norman et al. (2002) determined siderophile and volatile elements (Ni, Ir and Au are very high in analysis by Palme). The large porous clast has apparently not been analyzed.

Analyses for carbon and sulfur in 76015 are given in Gibson and Moore (1974) and Phinney (1981). Analyses for U, Th and Pb by Silver (1974) are given in Phinney (1981).

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Cadogen and Turner (1976) used the Ar/Ar plateau technique to get the age of 76015. They studied both the martix and two plagioclase separates getting 3.93 b.y., 3.92 b.y. and 3.96 b.y. respectively. Nyquist et al. (1974) reported Rb and Sr isotope studies.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Crozaz et al. (1974) reported a 81Kr-Kr exposure age of 17.5 ± 0.5 m.y. Cadogen and Turner (1974) determined 14 m.y. for matrix and 20 m.y. for plagioclase using 38Ar. This is mysteriously less than the value from 76315 (22 m.y.), possibly due to some erosional effect.

## **Vugs**

76015 has numerous vugs and cavities with well-known lunar orientation (Wolfe et al. 1981). Morrison and Zinner (1975) used two of these cavities to study the possible directional variations in the flux of micrometeorites and solar flare particles. Studies by Morrison and Zinner (figure 12) and by Blanford et al. (1975)(figure13) found no evidence for aniotropy in the flux of micrometeorites between the north direction and the eclyptic. However, Morrison and Clanton (1979) have apparently determined some directional differences and an elongated vug (that would have made a great pencil holder) has been prepared for additional studies (figures 22 and 23).

# **Other Studies**

Crozaz et al. (1974) reported Kr isotopes while Hohenberg et al. (1980) reported the Xe isotopes. Bogard (1974) also collected data on rare gases.

Crozaz et al. (1974) studied cosmic ray tracks in 76015. The solar flare track exposure age (18 m.y.) is found to be concordant with the galactic proton age (17 m.y.) – but these ages appear young when compared with other exposure ages for this boulder.

Wentworth et al. (1999) studied the patina on 76015 due to "space weathering".

Pearce et al. (1974) and Gose et al. (1978) have carefully studied the remanent magnetization of 26 subsamples of the big boulder, including 76015. The direction of magnetization of clast-free samples from unit B (including 76015) cluster fairly well after partial demagnetization by alternating field scrubing. Gose et al. proposed that the natural remanent magnetization of impact melt breccias is the vector sum of two magnetization, a pre-impact magnetization combined with a partial thermoremanence acquired during breccia lithification.

Delano (1976) experimentally determined the depthtemperature phase relations for 76015 (figure 14), but these may not be relavent because the sample appears to be a mixture of components.

Charette and Adams (1977) have compared the refectance spectra of 76015 with other samples, but one wonders about the effects of patina on specta obtained from orbit. Specta of the thick patina on surfaces of 76015 and 76215, should be compared with spectra of fresh brokne surfaces.

## **Processing**

A slab (,20) and a column were cut from the center of this rock (figures 17 and 21). A second slab and column (,148) were cut at right angles to the first slab (figures 18-20). The column (,148) was cut such as to capture the deep "pencil holder" vug which was cut and quartered to open up the inside for J.A. McDonnell (figure 22 and 23). There are 36 thin sections of 76015.

A large sample of 76015 is on public display in Germany (figure 24).(see nice essay by Eric Jones)

Meyer (1994) and Phinney (1981) included discussion of 76015 in their catalogs.
