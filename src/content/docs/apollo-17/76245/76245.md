## **Introduction**

These are probably chips from the station 6 boulder (block 4), but they could be from the regolith that the boulder sits on (Wolf et al. 1981). They were sieved from a soil collected in the shadow of the boulder – see section on 76240. They have never been studied and there are no thin sections.

## **Petrography**

These samples are dust covered, but appear to be tangrey, vesicular and fine –grained.
