# **Introduction**

Ryder (1993) and Wolfe et al. (1981) provided thorough reviews of the science that has been accomplished on breccia sample 73215. This sample is noteworthy in that it contains a collection of rock clasts with a range of petrologic types and ages (Jessberger et al. 1977).

73215 is a polymict breccia that was collected from the rim of a 10 meter crater that was in turn on the rim of Lara Crater (500 m)(figures 2 - 4). It is part of the light mantle material from the landslide off of the South Massif and is generally thought to be Serenitatis ejecta (Wolfe et al. 1981). It has micrometeorite craters on one side (figure 1) and an exposure age of ~240 m.y.

# **Petrography**

Lunar sample 73215 is essentially a collection of rock clasts included in an aphanitic, banded matrix of mineral debris. It has been cut into four pieces, two "butt ends" (,8 and ,9) and two parallel slabs (figures 7, 12, 26 and 27). The first slab cut from 73215 was carefully studied by a large consortium of scientists led by Odette James (see James et al. 1975; James 1976;

James and Hammerstrom 1977 and associated papers). The second slab revealed additional clasts, some of which were studied by Eckert et al. (1991a, b) and Neal and Taylor (1998).

The matrix of 73215 is described in detail by James and 18 others (1975). Chemical analyses of various portions of the matrix proved to be generally similar (table 1 a, b)(Blanchard et al. 1976). The overall structure of 73215 (figures 5, 26) is dominated by "flow banding" formed by differential flow and /or shear during and after aggregation and consolidation. Minute white lines that are traces of planes of fine-scale shear

grain size (figure 6). The grain size distribution appears seriate (figure 8). Reflected light shows that the matrix has a fine wormy porosity. An analysis of the modal mineralogy of grains >5 microns shows general similarity of the different matrix types and with the aphanitic clast (James 1976).

Dence et al. (1976) and Dence and Grieve (1976) described 73215 as genetically comparable with terrestrial suevites although, for some reason, there is not much evidence for shock and/or thermal history.

# **Important Clasts**

# *Felsite 43,3*

Perhaps the most important clast in 73215 is the small (~20 mg) felsite clast (,43-3) that was studied by the James Consortium, because the rather precise crystallization age obtained for this small clast has been used to establish the age of this breccia, which is then interpreted as the age of the Serenitatis Impact (Wolfe et al. 1981). Warren (1993) lists it as possibly pristine.

James and Hammarstrom (1976) describe this clast as partially crystalline and partially glassy. The texture of the crystalline portion is a vermicular intergrowth of quartz (40%) and K,Ba-feldspar (60%). Sparse grains of irregular anhedral plagioclase, blocky ilmenite and ovoid olivine grains are also present. Pyroxene and olivine are Fe-rich (figure 14). Felsic glass surrounds and intrudes the crystalline portion. A variety of minerals, including zircon, are included as relics in the glass (see James and Hammarstrom for a full

(1977) obtained a crystallization age of  $3.90 \pm 0.05$  b.y. by internal Rb-Sr isochron technique (figure 18), confirmed by Jessberger et al. (1977) as  $3.92 \pm 0.04$  b.y. by the Ar-Ar plateau technique (figure 17).

#### 7002, Dunite ,539 ,580

The third saw cut, which produced the second slab, exposed a large powdery greenish-tan clast (,539) which proved hard to extract (figures 5, 7). A grain mount showed that it was mostly olivine (Fo<sub>89-93</sub>) with significant pyroxene (figure 22) and plagioclase (An<sub>91</sub>) as well as trace spinel (Eckert et al. 1991 and Neal and Taylor 1998). The analysis of ,539 showed low Eu (figure 21), but significant REE (possibly contamination). This dunite clast deserves more attention.

## Spinel Troctolite ,534 ,579 ,7001

Spinel troctolite ,534 (figure 7) has a recrystallized porphyoblastic texture with about 20% olivine (Fo<sub>89-92</sub>), 78% plagioclase (An<sub>91-96</sub>) and ~2% Al-spinel (Cr/Cr+Al=10) and minor amounts of pyroxene (figure 24), Fe-Ni metal and chromite (Eckert et al. 1991; Neal and Taylor 1998). It has a positive Eu anomaly (figure 21).

## Spinel Troctolite,32

Bence et al. (1975) were the first to recognize spinel troctolite as a clast type in 73215 (table 2a, figure 19).

# Spinel Troctolite-basalt ,170

A 5 mm clast (,170) has been described as a pink-spinel-bearing troctolitic basalt by James and Hedenquist (1978). Texturally the clast consists of patches of basaltic-textured rock enclosed by very fine grained granoblastic rock. The calculated mode is ~52% olivine (Fo<sub>82-87</sub>), 5% low-Ca pyroxene (Wo<sub>4</sub>En<sub>84</sub>), 6% high-Ca pyroxene (Wo<sub>44</sub>En<sub>50</sub>), 36% plagioclase (An<sub>84-95</sub>), trace chromite and ilmenite. Blanchard et al. (1977) and Higuchi and Morgan (1975) produced analyses (table 2). Jessberger (1979) determined a high temperature Ar-Ar release age of  $4.46 \pm 0.04$  b.y. (figure 23).

## Anorthositic Norite 29,9 coarse-grained

This prominent clast (figures 11, 28) has granulitic, relatively coarse-grained texture with blocky subhedral plagioclase grains  $(An_{95})$  (up to 1 mm), rounded irregular olivine grains  $(Fo_{70.75})$  (0.2 mm) and minor augite "globules"  $(Wo_{40}En_{45})$  poikilitically enclosed in orthopyoxene  $(Wo_{4}En_{75})$  (1 mm) (James and Hammarstrom 1977). It has been analyzed by Blanchard et al. (1977) and Morgan et al. (1979) (table 2a, figure 21).

## Anorthositic Norite 46,25 46,33

James and Hammarstrom (1977) termed this clast "anorthositic gabbro", but it is compositionally a norite or texturally a "granulite". Equant plagioclase  $(An_{95})$  and olivine  $(Fo_{78})$  crystals form a mosaic with grain junctions commonly at 120 degree angles. Pyroxene forms oikocrysts scattered throughout the matrix (figure 17). Blanchard et al. (1977) give analyses (figure 21) and Compston et al. (1977) found it fit a 4.24 b.y. isochron (figure 22).

# Aphanitic Clasts "BC" and "GS"

James (1976) and Blanchard et al. (1976) described the dark fine-grained aphanitic clasts in 73215 showing that they were made of the same materials as the matrix of 73215 (only more densely packed and finer grained). *Large Clast* 

The obvious large triangular clast (1 inch) exposed by the third saw cut (figures 5 and 7) appears to not have been studied (probably because it is itself a breccia).

# Chemistry

The bulk chemical composition of 73215 and related aphanitic matrix samples of the South Massif is generally similar to that of the micropoikilitic boulder samples from the North Massif (Wolfe 1981). Eldridge et al. (1974) reported U, Th and K determined by radiation counting of the whole rock (table 1b). These values are similar to that determined on much smaller samples of the matrix by various investigators (table 1). Bence et al. (1975) were the first to report analyses of matrix and clasts in 73215 (tables 1 and 2, figure 11). These results were confirmed by the analyses of Blanchard et al. (1976, 1977).

A wide variety of lithic clasts have been recognized – from felsite to dunite (table 2). The composition of the dunite (,539) and spinel troctolite (,534) clasts in 73215 was determined by Roman Schmitt and reported by Neal and Taylor 1998 (table 2b, figure 21). Although these clasts are probably pristine, they could not be extracted cleanly from the breccia matrix ans show some Ir and Au content. Putchel et al. (2002) have extended these studies.

## Radiogenic age dating

Jessberger et al. (1977) reported Ar-Ar plateau ages for a large number of sub-samples of 73215 – matrix and clasts (table 3). They noted that some clasts had a high-temperature plateau that was older than a low-temperature plateau and reported two ages for these clasts. Muller et al. (1977) and Eichorn et al. (1978) used a pulsed laser to degas Ar from local areas in the interior of clasts and at the margins showing that the clasts were partially degassed during breccia formation. The older ages for the anorthositic norite clasts were generally concordant with the Rb-Sr results of Compston et al. (1977)(figure 22). Jessberger (1979) also obtained an old age (4.42 b.y.) for pink-spinel-bearing troctolitic basalt clast (figure 23).

The concordant age obtained by Ar-Ar and Rb-Sr for the felsite clast (3.92 b.y., old decay constants) has been used to date the age of the breccia forming event (which, in turn, yields the age the Serenitatis Basin)(Compston et al. 1977; Jessberger et al. 1977; James et al. 1977; Wolfe et al. 1981).

The James Consortium also reported U, Th, Pb and Nd, Sm isotopic data for the matrix of 73215 (James and 18 others, 1975).

## Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

O'Kelley et al. (1974) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of <sup>26</sup>Al (85 dpm/kg), <sup>22</sup>Na (59 dpm/kg), <sup>54</sup>Mn (36 dpm/kg), <sup>56</sup>Co (51 dpm/kg) and <sup>46</sup>Sc (3 dpm/kg). This activity (corrected back to liftoff) was higher than for rocks from earlier missions due to the effects of an intense solar flare in August 1972.

Jessberger et al. (1976, 1977) determined the 38Ar exposure ages (average 244 ± 9 m.y.) in close agreement with the Kr-Kr exposure age 243 ± 7 m.y. determined by Kurt Marti (James and 18 others, 1975). This is generally taken as the age of the landslide off of South Massif.

# **Processing**

Two slabs have been cut from 73215, the **first** in 1973 and the **second**, parallel to the first, in 1988. Saw marks are visible on the sawn surfaces which means that the slab samples were substantially heated during dry sawing. The first slab was carefully dissected and studied by the James Consortium (James and Blanchard 1976). However, it proved to be difficult to cleanly separate the clasts from the second slab and data for only two of them have been reported. Altogether, 158 thin sections have been prepared for 73215!
