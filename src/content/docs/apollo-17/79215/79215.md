## **Introduction**

Sample 79215 was found on the surface near Van Serg Crater (Muehlberger et al. 1974). It's orientation on the surface is known from photographs (see figure 224 in Wolfe et al. 1981) and from the distinct "soil line" around the sample (figure 1). Light-colored rocks in the bottom of Van Serg Crater may be related.

79215 is a holocrystalline, feldspar-rich rock with a granoblastic texture that was formed by a high temperature metamorphic process of unknown origin. The sample is low in KREEP elements, but high in meteoritic siderophiles. It is apparently an annealed aggregate of relict anorthositic and troctolitic cumulates, with an added meteoritic componet. Within 79215 are numerous "oxide complexes" with surrounding reaction corona. The temperature of

metamorphism can be calculated from mineral pairs (800 to 950 deg C).

79215 has been dated at ~ 3.9 ± 0.1 b.y., with a long exposure to cosmic rays (170 - 330 m.y.) It is an oriented sample with a thick patina and numerous micrometeorite craters.

## **Petrography**

McGee et al. (1979) and Neal and Taylor (1993) summarized what is known about 79215. This large rock is a coherent granulitic impactite, characterized by a granoblastic matrix of equant plagioclase grains (An95; 0.1 mm) which meet at 120 deg triple junctions with smaller intersertal grains of olivine, pyroxene and opaque minerals (Bickel et al. 1976; McGee et al. 1978)(figure 2).

The mineralogic mode was determined for 9 regions in 79215 (see tables). McGee et al. (1978) determined that the rock is about 72% matrix and 28% relict lithic clasts. This variation is also seen in the chemical data of Blanchard et al. (1977). On average the sample is about 80 % plagioclase, 10 % olivine and 8 % pyroxene.

In spite of the variation in mineral mode, the mineral compositions are rather constant (equilibrated?).

McGee et al. (1978) studied numerous reaction corona surronding small "opaque complexes" in the matrix. These complexes consist of core assemblages which may include spinel, ilmenite, armalcolite, troilite, rutile and metallic iron which are surrounded by corona of plagioclase and occasionally olivine. Chomite spinel is the dominant constiuent of the oxide assemblages. The plagioclase in the corona are slightly zoned outward from An96-90.

The temperature of metamorphism can be calculated from the composition of high and low-Ca pyroxene (Cushing et al. 1999) and/or olivine-ilmenite pairs (Anderson and Lindsley 1979). Cushing et al. determined the annealing temperature as 1082 deg C, while Anderson and Lindsley calculate only 660 deg C. McGee et al. (1978) calculated anealling temperatures from 800 to 950 deg C from several mineral pairs.

#### **Mineralogy**

**Pyroxene:** Bickel et al. (1976), McGee et al. (1978), Cushing et al. (1999) and Hudgins et al. (2008) all report pyroxene composition (figure 5).

**Olivine:** The olivine in 79215 has a range in composition (Fo<sub>72-86</sub>).

*Chromite:* Spinel ranges in composition from chromite to ulvospinel (McGee et al. 1978).

*Ilmenite*: McGee et al. found 6-10% MgO in ilmenite.

*Metallic iron:* The Ni and Co data for metal in 79215 originally reported by Bickel et al. (1976), were simply repeated by Ryder et al. (1980).

**Apatite:** Megacrysts of subhedral apatite (up to 1.5 mm) are observed in many of the sections and are believed to have formed during annealing (McGee et al. 1979). Bickel et al. (1976) give a partial analysis.

*Armalcolite:* McGee et al. determined the chemical composition of armalcolite.

## **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of several pieces of 79215 is given by Blanhard et al. (1977) and Lindstrom and Lindstrom (1986). Fruchter et al. (1975) measured the Th content of the whole sample (550 grams) by radiation counting. Note that the Th for the bulk rock

#### **Summary of Age Data for 79215**

is higher than for the individual splits that were measured. Hudgins et al. (2008) and Higuchi and Morgan (1975) also analysed the sample, finding high siderophiles throughout. The REE pattern is flat and similar to that of other feldspathic granulites (figure 8).

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Both McGee et al. (1978) and Hudgins et al. (2008) obtained good plateau ages by the stepwise heating technique, but they are not in agreement (figures 9 11). McGee et al. and Hudgins et al. also used the laser probe technique to date spots.

Murthy (1978) reported the initial Sr isotope ratio for plagioclase from 79215. Oberli et al. (1979) reported Pb.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

McGee et al. (1978) reported an Ar exposure age of 170 ± 10 m.y., while Hudgins et al. (2008) reported an Ar exposure age of 339 ± 24.2 m.y.

Nautiyal et al. (1981) and Venkatesan et al. (1982) determined cosmogenic He, Ne, Ar and Xe as a function of depth in 79215. Bhandari (1977) studied tracks and measured 26Al a function of depth. These SCR depth profile studies have not been interpreted.

## **Other Studies**

Hohenberg et al. (1980) reported Xe isotopes determined by Morgan (1975). Venkatesan et al. (1982) also reported the isotopic ratio of Xe.

## **Processing**

79215 is an oriented sample with a thick patina and numerous micrometeorite craters. A two-part slab was cut through the rock (figure 13). Half of the slab is thin (~2 mm) and broke into pencil-shaped pieces (,4) and half is thick (~1.5 cm) and subdivided (,5 ,6 ,7 ,9).
