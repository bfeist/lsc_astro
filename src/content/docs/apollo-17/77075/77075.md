# **Introduction**

Samples 77075, 77076 and 77077 were sampled from one of the dark dikes within the large, off-white "noritic" clast in the boulder at Station 7 (see the section on the Station 7 Boulder). The dike is about 3 cm thick (Chao et al. 1974), and has portions of the white clast attached on both sides. The white "noritic" material (77077, figure 5) is the same as sample 77215

(figure 1). Piece 19 of 77215 also appears to be identical to 77075.

The dark dike material in 77075 is a fragment-laden melt rock with a matrix texture and chemical composition generally similar to sample 77115, except it has a finer grain size (Chao et al. 1974). Schmitt (in Schmitt and Cernan, 1973) observed that the dike

CDR That's one of the blue-gray rocks. And it's got a lightcolored fragment that runs the full height of it, about a meter and a half thick. And then it's got the gray or blue-gray rock on the other side. As a matter of fact – let me look at it closely. It's a fragment in it all right. I wouldn't be absolutely positive, but it sure looks like I see a dikelet in here that's in the inclusion. And I'm going to get a clsoeup stereo of it. I'd call it a dikelet, if you pinned me down. I wish I could break a sample off. Here's another one. It is a dikelet. There's three or four of them. The material in the dike looks – yes, it's not covering it. It's between the lighter colored rock, and it's the blue-gray rock. Well, maybe it isn't a dikelet. Maybe it's just a screen covering, a flow covering.

LMP No, there're dikes. They're little veinlets of –

CDR Let me get this whole thing in a bag. I got a rock, bob. It's fractured, primarily around a dike. It's in several pieces, but we're going to put in all in one bag (543 = 77215).

LMP We need to put one of those dikes in another bag. It looks like some fraction of the blue-gray material has obviously intruded. Now, can you get that dike there? Piece of it?

CDR I can get it right here. Yes. It's this soft, white inclusion again. It breaks pretty easy. Oh, It's got to be a dike. Oh, Yes, it is because I broke into it.

LMP It is. ((544 = 77075, 77076) Although the blue-gray up on the hill looked like a fragment of breccias, if this is still related, then it's – been some partial melting at some time.

CDR There's a preserved contact between the dike and the – white material.

LMP That's what I wanted.

CDR Why don't we get this big piece of dike now?

LMP See if you can get – whoa! Don't hit it again. There, you've still got some contact there.

CDR Now, there's some good contact. That'll do it.

LMP Dike and intruded rock in 544. Now, these dikes are a dark bluish-gray. And it looks like they are finely crystalline – maybe with some –very fine phenocrysts.

CDR I'm taking some closeups.

LMP We ought to get a piece of the normal gray that the dikes are coming from. Hey, over here on this side, it looks like the vesicular anorthositic gabbro. (bag 561 = 77115) That's a sample of the gray, looks like recrystallized breccias that the dikes are continuous with.

material was continuous with the "blue-gray, matrixrich breccia" (represented by 77115) that surrounds the off-white "noritic" clast that the dike cuts (figures 2 and 3).

This sample and others from the Station 7 boulder were studied by the International Consortium led by Ed Chao (see summary by Minkin et al. 1978). The results on 77075 were also summarized in the catalog by Meyer (1994).

# **Petrography**

Dike rock 77075 is the finest grained, most fragmentrich lithology of the station 7 boulder (Chao et al. 1974, Minkin et al. 1978). The holocrystalline matrix is a fine-grained intergrowth of subophitic plagioclase and pyroxene, with minor olivine and ilmenite. Average grain size is 5-10 microns with poikilitic pyroxenes 10-20 microns. A few percent mineral and lithic clasts are also present (figure 6). The dense, dark dike has a sharp boundary with the porous, "noritic" microbreccia (figure 7).

McGee et al. (1980) conclude that the 77075 dike crystallized and cooled through the solidus more rapidly than did the enclosing lithologies 77115 and 77135. Presumably, the relatively rapid cooling of the dike also inhibited precipitation of augite. It is thought that the incorporation of cool clasts into the melt, and injection of the melt into a cooler noritic host, contributed to rapid initial cooling and the fine grain

size of the dark dike material (McGee et al. 1980, Sanford and Heubner 1980).

# **Mineralogy**

*Pyroxene*: The composition of pyroxene in the melt rock portion was determined by TEM (McGee et al. 1980), because it was too fine grained for accurate electron microprobe analysis (Figure 8). Augite was not seen in 77075 by microscope, but was found as 10 micron exsolution lamellae using TEM techniques. Bersch (1991) precisely determined the composition of the orthopyroxene in the white "noritic" portion of 77075.

*Plagioclase*: The plagioclase in the matrix of 77075 is An , while some xenoliths of plagioclase range to 89-92 An97 (Chao et al. 1974).

*Olivine*: Small xenocrysts of olivine (Fo66-93) are found in the matrix of 77075 (Chao et al. 1974, Minkin et al. 1978).

*Other minerals*: Ilmenite is very fine and platy (Chao et al. 1974). Blebs of Fe-Ni are present.

# **Chemistry**

Winzer et al. (1974) and Norman et al. (2002) have analyzed the aphanitic dark dike and Warren and Wasson (1978) analyzed the white material attached (table 1 and figure 10). The composition of the dark dike matches that of 77115 and the white material is the same crushed norite as 77215.

The trace element data of Norman et al. (2002) and that of Morgan et al. (1974) generally agree and they both report high Ir in the dike material.

## Radiogenic age dating

Stettler et al. (1974, 1978) determined an age of  $3.97 \pm 0.04$  b.y. for the dark dike (average of three measurements). Nakamura and Tatsumoto (1977) determined a Rb/Sr isochron for the dark dike (4.18 b.y.), as well as an imprecise Sm/Nd isochron (figure 13), but their sample may have included xenoliths of older material. Nunes et al. (1974) also reported U, Th, Pb data for 77075.

#### Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

Stettler et al. (1974) obtained an exposure age of 25.5 m.y. for 77075 by the Ar method. A review of the exposure ages determined for this boulder is given in Arvidson et al. (1975).

## **Processing**

The initial processing and distribution of 77075 is outlined in Butler and Dealing (1974). It was studied by the International Consortium led by Ed Chao (final report by Minkin et al. 1978). A detailed description of the splits was documented in USGS Open File Report 78-511.

Numerous close-up photos were taken of boulder 7 during sampling (see transcript). 77075, 77076 and 77077 were returned from the Moon in the same sample bag (Butler 1973). Three pieces fit nicely together (figures 14, 15 and 16) and were called 77075. 77076 appears to be identical. 77077 appears to be the adjacent white clast – also sampled as 77215.

There are 7 thin sections of 77075 and 6 for 77077.
