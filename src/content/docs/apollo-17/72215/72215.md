## **Introduction**

Lunar sample 72215 was collected from the side of a layered boulder #1 at station 2 located on the bottom slope of the South Massif and within the landslide material at Apollo 17 Taurus-Littrow (Schmitt 1973, Wolfe et al. 1981). Samples 72235, 72255 and 72275 are from other layers in this boulder and soils 72220, 72240 and 72260 are from the fillet surrounding the boulder. The boulder had a prominent layering with multi-layered clasts weathering out as "knobs" (figure 1). 72215 was sampled as one of the largest of these "knobs" (~10 cm).

The "knobs" are intricate swirls of light and dark, interlayerd, crushed highland materials produced in some, as yet, unexplained fluidized impact mechanism. The dark portions are finer-grained and the lighter are coarser-grained – but both portions are found to have similar bulk composition. Two of these "knobs" were given special names: Marble Cake (72275) and Dying Dog (72235) by the Consortium Indomitable who first studied them. Aspects of 72215 are similar.

The sample is a coherent, clast-rich, impact melt breccia. It is aluminous and feldspathic and contains

numerous small patches of "granitic" material. It has been preliminary dated at 3.83 b.y. and has an exposure age of 42 m.y.

## **Petrography**

Ryder (1993) provides a complete review of the work accomplished on 72215. Briefly, 72215 has a prominent layering that has been described by Ryder et al. (1974) and Stoeser et al. (1975) as separate "domains" – seen in figure 3 and 4.

Domains 1, 2 and 3 are similar in chemical composition, but differ in color and average

Domain 5 is darker than the others and more vesicular. It has an abundance of granitic patches or clasts (up to 23%!). Broad beam analyses show it has higher K<sub>2</sub>O.

Domain 6 (GA) is white, coarse-grained and cataclasized. It is made up of relic areas of poikilitic granulite and crushed equivalent. Equidimentional chadocrysts of plagioclase  $(An_{90.96})$  are embedded in large pyroxene oikocrysts  $(En_{75}Wo_4)$ .

## **Significant Clasts**

#### Granite

The "granitic" clasts in boulder 1, including those in 72215, were analyzed and described by Ryder et al. (1975) and Stoeser et al. (1995). They have high silica (>75%) and high  $K_2O$  contents (~6%)(table 1). They are made of various intergrowths of silica, Ba,K feldspar, ternary feldspar (figure 7) and Fe-rich pyroxene (figure 6). Compston et al. (1975) determined a "mixing line" with apparent age of ~4 b.y. for these Rb-rich "granitic" assemblages (figure 11).

### GA ,76

The white clast marked as GA in the figures 3, 4 and 14 is a cataclastic, poikilitic anorthositic norite. The analysis show that it is low in trace elements and high in alumina (Blanchard et al. 1974). It is also known as "domain 6".

## Pink Spinel, Troctolite basalt

Small clasts of basalt containing Mg-spinel and/or olivine have been reported (Table 3).

# **Chemistry**

Palme et al. (1978), Blanchard et al. (1975), Morgan et al. (1975) have analyzed 72215 (table 1, figure 10). In addition, Stoeser used the broad beam electron probe to obtain the composition of the various domains (table 3). Eveyrthing is high alumina and there is not much different about the various domains – other than grain size and appearance.

Morgan et al. (1975) found that meteoritic siderophiles (Ir, Re, Os etc.) have different ratios (figure 11) from other lunar breccias and discuss this in context to the Serenitatis ejecta.

### Radiogenic age dating

Schaeffer et al. (1982) dated the matrix and various clasts using the Ar/Ar laser technique.

Compston et al. (1975) reported data for an anorthosite clast, the matrix and various granitic clasts (figure 12).

Nunes and Tatsumoto (1975) studied the U-Th-Pb systematics, but could not obtain an age.

## **Summary of Age Data for 72215**

Ar/Ar Rb/Sr Schaeffer et al. 3.83 – 4.02 b.y Compston et al. ~ 4 b.y.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

The cosmic-ray exposure age of 72215 was determined as 41.4 m.y. by 81Kr and 41 m.y. by 38Ar methods (Leich et al. 1975). This is less than the exposure age of samples form the top of the boulder (e.g. 72275), probably because of shielding or erosion effects. Arvidson et al. (1976) have proposed that this is the age of Tyco!

# **Processing**

The original processing of 72215 was documented by Marvin (1974). A sawcut lengthwise through the sample produced a slab (,15) with one side sawn and the other original surface (figure 13). At a later time additional material was provided to Ryder. There are 30 thin sections. The main mass is still intact (as of 2007).
