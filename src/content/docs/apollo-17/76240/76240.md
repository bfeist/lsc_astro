#### **Introduction**

76240 is a surface sample collected from a depth of 0 76240 is a "permanently shadowed" soil sample – 4 or 5 cm and has a maturity index Is/FeO = 56 collected ~1 meter under the overhang of a 5x4x3 meter (submature) with about 48% agglutinates (Heiken and boulder (#4) at station 6, South Massif (figure 1), which McKay 1974). Sample 76240 is to be compared with was downslope from blocks #2 and #3 (figure 2). This reference soil 76260 (Is/FeO = 58; 45% agglutinates) material has remained in the shadow for as long as the collected from the sunlit surface nearby (figure 1). big boulder has been there (~22 m.y.; Crozaz and others Sample 76280 (Is/FeO = 45; 45% agglutinates) was 1974). 76261 and 76281 were collected nearby for collected from beneath 76260 (1 – 5 cm depth). Sample comparison.

76240 has a mean grain size of 53 microns compared with 76260 and 76280 of 58 microns (McKay et al. 1974). *One may conclude that these soils are very like each other, except that 76240 was permanently shadowed from the sun for the length of time that the boulder has been on top of it.* 

The large station 6 boulders sit on the local soil, shielding the soils underneath from recent cosmic rays, and also partially shielding adjacent soils. Indeed the 22Na and 26Al activity measured for 76240 are less than they would have been if the shadowed soil had been unshielded. However, this shadowed soil sample still has an activity higher than expected. Taken at face value, the boulder would have to have been emplaced within the last 1 m.y. (but, in fact, we know it to be ~22 m.y.). One possibility is that the shadowed soil

has recently received a component of unshadowed soil "kicked" under the boulder by nearby impacts into adjacent soil.

The station 6 soils contain (as an important component) "dark mantle materials that extend locally onto the lower slopes of the Massif" (Wolfe et al. 1981).

Sample 76215 is a breccia sample from the top of the boulder that protects 76240.

## **Petrography**

76240 appears to be similar to reference soils 76260 and 76280 collected just outside the shadow. Morris (1978) determined the maturity index of 76240, 76261 and 76281 as (Is /FeO =56, 58 and 45, respectively). The grain size distribution is shown in figures 7 and 8.

Meyer (1973) cataloged the 4 – 10 mm coarse-fine particles and Jolliff et al. (1996) studied numerous 2 – 4 mm coarse-fine particles from 76283.

## **Chemistry**

Hubbard et al. (1974), Morgan et al. (1974), Baedecker et al. (1974) and Korotev and Kremser (1992) determined the composition of the shadowed soil 76240 and sunlit comparison samples 76260, 76280 (tables 1 and 2, figure 3 and 4). Simonds (1975) and others determined the composition of the boulder (sample 76215). Figure 4 shows the difference in chemical composition between the soil and the boulder. Figure 5 presents the carbon content.

#### **Volatiles**

Von Guten et al. (1982) found excess Hg in shadowed sample 76240 compared with sunlit control sample 76260. Baedecker et al. (1974) and Morgan et al. (1974) found excess Cd in the shadowed soil (76240), compared with the reference soil (76260). However, Jovanovic and Reed (1974) found the same amount of Hg in 76240 as in 76260 (2 – 3 ppm).

Moore et al. (1974) a nd Gibson and Moore (1974) showed that 76240 had the same amount of sulfur as 76260 (~850 ppm). Jovanovic and Reed (1974) determined Hg, Os, Ru and U in 76241, 76261 (< 1 mm fraction). Norris et al. (1983) determined C and N (and their isotopic compositions).

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Keith et al. (1974) and Rancitelli et al. (1974) determined the cosmic ray induced activity of 76240 and 76260 (table 3). There is surprisingly high activity for 22Na and 56Co (both short half-lives) for 76240 (permanently shadowed soil sample) indicating that the boulder was emplaced rather recently (< m.y.). However, Crozaz et al. (1974) and Arvidson et al. (1975) give 22 m.y. as the time of emplacement of the station 6 boulder based on 81Kr exposure ages of boulder samples (76315, 76015, 76055). This creates an interesting dilemma !

Strangely, Keith et al. (1974) and Yokoyama et al. (1975) found that 76240 was "saturated" with 22Na (41 dpm/kg) and the "26Al activity was considerably higher that might be expected". Keith et al. offer two explanations: "that the boulder rolled over this soil recently or, more reasonably, that the filleting has been the result of movement of material from the top few millimeters of the regolith under the boulder as a result of small meteorite bombardment".

*Figure 7: Grain size distribution for 76260 (Graf 1993, data from McKay).* 

Fruchter et al. (1981) suggest that cosmic-ray-activated material is eroded off the top of the boulder, finding its way under the boulder – by gardening of the regolith.

## **Other Studies**

Durrani et al. (1976) found substantial release of natural thermoluminescence on slow heating of 76240. The sample used had been kept frozen following return to the Earth at the request of Durrani. A reference sunlit soil which had not been kept cold was found to release less light on heating (figure 6). Durrani et al. used their data to calculate the average temperature (256 deg. K) and the duration of the shadow (~65, 000 yr.)!

# **Processing**

A portion (20 G) of this shadowed sample was placed in a freezer (~ January 30, 1973), but was removed on or about January 1974 (CO#1637) to split a cold portion for SADurrani (details are important). The sample was delivered (cold) to Durrani March 22, 1974. The remainder of the frozen sample has been in the freezer ever since (no further processing). Other samples have been in sealed in cans and bags.
