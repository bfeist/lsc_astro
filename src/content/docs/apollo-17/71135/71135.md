## **Transcript at station 1** you reach it?

from a hummocky vesicularity to a very fine vesicularity. Look other little piece in sight. at this. Let me try and crack see that? The change? CDR OK, I got that piece in sight, too. Let me –

LMP Yes, that's what I'm after; that's it. That's what I saw in LMP Let me get them both right now. that other boulder (71055?) CDR Okay, this is a sample of a more coarsely vesicular rock.

CDR Let's see if I can't crack the corner and get that contact.

LMP Yes. And get a piece of both – think you can get - if you can reach down there. That's a contact in a rock.

CC Do you guys see any 2-meter boulders around there?

CDR We just sampled one - -

LMP We're not where you think we are. We're not sure where we are. Gene, can you get down into that? Need some help?

CDR Yes, just give me a shovel to hold myself with. Give me a shove.

LMP How about that one?

CDR Yes.

LMP Get that little piece.

CDR OK, I see it. It's pretty hard. See if I can't. It's low and hard to hit.

LMP How about coming around from this side?

CDR Well, I got the gnomon in the wrong place really. Can

CDR Hey, look at this rock, where the vesicularity changes LMP Well, I'm going to lean on the rock maybe. I got the

LMP You got it in your hand? CDR OK, I got both of these.

LMP OK, I just got a chunk of that side. Right there that piece.

CDR I got them both. I think, actually, we got a sample of LMP See that rock right over there on the little mound, just both sides; but I wouldn't bet on it. projecting out of the edge of it? There you go; you just touch it.

CDR OK, let me get these in a bag here.

LMP Well, I'll get that piece; and that the samples from either side of the contact anyway. Can you get a bag - -

CRD They're pretty small. Give me a hammer, and get a bag and I'll - - I got these in my hand I want to put there.

LMP bag 477 is the coarsely vesicular rock (71135, 71136)

CDR Are there two of them there? I hope two of them fell in.

LMP No, I only got one.

CDR OK, here's that other one. It had to fall right here.

LPM Now your're full of dirt in the scoop; you just covered it

up.

CDR Got it; I got it. A little dirt never hurt anybody.

LMP Here, put it in here with the dirt. That's good. In 477 are two chips – there're small, but I think they'll give you the – if there's any compositional difference (elapsed time ~ 4 min).

LMP In bag 478 is the chip from the more finely vesicular rock (71155). Both of them are coarse. It's a small chip; but it'll tell the story I think. Gene, if you can pick up one more rock in that picture, with your tongs, let's bag it. I've got a sample that was laying next to that boulder (71175).

#### **Introduction**

Figure 1 shows a very vesicular boulder on the rim of a small (10m) crater, which is itself on the ejecta blanket of Steno Crater (figure 2). The astronauts spotted what appeared to be a contact between two areas of different vesicularity. They hammered off two pieces (71135 and 71136) from one side of the contact and one piece from the other side (71155) (see transcript).

71135 and 71136 are vesicular ilmenite basalt with both freshly broken and exposed surfaces (figures 3 and 4). They are characterized by large sawtooth needles of ilmenite set in a fine-grained intergrown plagioclasepyroxene matrix (figures 6 and 7).

#### **Mineralogical Mode**

| Olivine     | tr.  |
|-------------|------|
| Pyroxene    | 49.7 |
| Plagioclase | 20   |
| Opaques     | 24.8 |
| Silica      | 1.2  |
| Meostasis   | 4.3  |

#### **Petrography**

Brown et al. (1975) and Neal and Taylor (1993) give brief descriptions of the mineral mode and texture, but a detailed petrographic study has never been reported. Usselman et al. (1975) performed controlled cooling experiments that yielded this texture at cooling rate ~ = 2-5 deg / hr.

#### **Chemistry**

Rhodes et al. (1976), Eldridge et al. (1974) and Warner et al. (1975) have reported similar compositions for these samples. Based on trace elements, it is classified as a type B1 basalt by Neal and Taylor (1993).

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Not dated, but Nyquist et al. (1975) reported whole rock values for Rb, Sr and Sr87/86.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Niemeyer et al. (1977) determined an exposure age for 71135 of ~ 102 m.y.

For 71135 O'Kelley et al. (1974) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 22Na = 95 dpm/kg., 26Al = 80 dpm/kg., 46Sc = 70 dpm/kg., 54Mn = 140 dpm/kg and 56Co = 290 dpm/kg. For 71136 they determined 22Na = 93 dpm/kg., 26Al = 90 dpm/kg., 46Sc = 70 dpm/ kg., 54Mn = 160 dpm/kg and 56Co = 300 dpm/kg.

#### **Processing**

71135 has been broken into pieces (figure 10). There are 8 thin sections for 71135 and 3 for 71136.
