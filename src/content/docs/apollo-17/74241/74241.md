# **Introduction**

The area on the rim of Shorty Crater where the Orange Soil was discovered was about 1 meter in size and "ellipsoidal" in dimension. The astronauts noted that it was covered with a light gray mantle (about 1 cm, see transcript for the excitement of this discovery). The astronauts dug a trench across the "ellipsoidal" area

and tried to determine the depth of the deposit with a double core. The gray soils from either end of the trench were 74240 and 74260 (figure 1). The Orange Soil (74220) was from the middle of this trench, and the core was immediately adjacent.

The astronauts also photographed the inner walls of Shorty Crater and could see vast amounts of orange material (Heiken et al. 1974, 1978). Several basalt samples were collected immediately adjacent to this trench or included in the soil bags (74235, 74255, 74275, 74245 – 74287, 74265).

Shorty Crater is  $\sim$  17 m.y. old, but the gray soils have a much older, and complicated, exposure history (see below).

# **Petrography**

The maturity of 74241 and 74261 is  $I_s/FeO = 5.1$  and 5, respectively, and the average grain size is 87 and 72 microns (Morris 1978, Graf 1993). This compares with about 37-46 microns for 74002 (top of core) and 74220 from orange soil middle of trench (see section on "orange soil"). The percentage of agglutinates is very low for a lunar soil (~8%).

Glass (1976) and Fruland et al. (1977) studied the glass particles in these gray soils. They found that there was abundant (10-20~%) ropy glass with a uniform highly aluminous composition ( $\sim 23\%~{\rm Al_2O_3}$ ). Fruland et al. also found that the ropy glass particles were consistently covered with a diagnostic sorted and welded fine-grained debris coating.

### Chemistry

The chemical composition was determined by Wanke et al. (1973), Nava (1974), Rhodes et al. (1974), Philpotts et al. (1974), Korotev and Kremser (1992)

and others (see tables and see section on 74220). There is much less Cr in these gray soils, compared with the orange soil.

LSPET (1973) and Moore et al. (1974) reported 55 and 45ppm carbon for 74240 and 74260 respectively, yet 100 ppm carbon for 74220 (figure). Muller (1974) determined 23 ppm nitrogen in 74241 with considerably higher amounts in the finest grain size (surface correlated). Chang et al. (1974) reported 50 and 42 ppm carbon and 18 and 18 ppm nitrogen for 74240 and 74260, respectively. Gibson and Moore (1974) reported 1080 ppm sulfur in 74260.

#### Radiogenic age dating

Silver (1974) and Nunes et al. (1974) reported the U, Th and Pb isotopic composition.

Lee et al. (1997) determined the Hf and W content and isotopic composition of tungsten.

### Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

The orange and gray soils at Shorty Crater have had a complicated exposure history (see Eugster 1985)

#### **Other Studies**

Eugster et al. (1977), Hubner et al. (1975) and Hintenberger et al. (1974) all determined rare gas content and isotopic composition.

Butler and Meyer (1976) studied the sulfur coatings on glass beads.

### **Transcript at Shorty Crater**

LMP It's orange!

CDR Wait a minute, let me put my visor up. It's still orange!

LMP Sure it is! Crazy! ORANGE! I've got to dig a trench, Houston.

CDR It's almost the same color as the LMP decal on my camera. That is orange, Jack!

LMP It's trench time. You can see this in your color television, I'll bet you.

CDR Jack, that is really orange. It's been oxidized.

LMP It looks just like – an oxidized desert soil, that's exactly right. That orange is along the rim crest. If there ever was something that looked like a fumarole alteration, this is it. I've trenched across the trend of the yellow – or the orange. There is light gray material on either side. You need to get down-sun color - - I'll get my black and white.

CDR Let's start sampling that trench. Look at where the contact between the gray and the –

CDR Before you disturb it, let me just get a couple of CDR close-ups of that. LMP LMP Hey, can you get a down-sun? I think the color will be best down-sun. CDR Okay. Let me get one more. Hey, you want any of CDR this bagged in the can, Bob? LMP LMP It's quite – undurated. CDR See if you can get a sample right across that contact too. CDR LMP I will. OK, bag that one. CDR Bag 509 *(74220)* has got the orange material from, LMP OH, about 2 to 3 inches down. CDR LMP OK, the light gray, which is on either side. Want me to get some more? CC CDR Yes, a little more. LMP All of this is getting a little bit *(mixed?)* with about LMP half-centimeter thick light-gray or a medium-gray covering over the whole area. CDR The light gray material that is adjacent to the red CC material is on *bag* 510 *(74240).* And that orange band is CDR about a meter wide, I think. LMP About a meter. LMP CRD You can't get to the bottom of it though, can you? LMP I haven't been able to yet. Just to be sure we sample this side of it, too? CDR *Bag* 511 *(74260)* has the gray from the other side CDR of the orange band. And the other side happens to be the crater side. LMP LMP That's right. North side. OK. I'm going to see if this goes on down here as a zone. CDR CDR It looks like it's ellipsoidal are if my footprints are any indication. CDR CC We'd like to get the double core here. LMP Did you want that in the orange? CC Rodger that. Affirm. LMP Well, it a vertical stratigraphy. Do you want to go LMP sideways a little with it? Or do you want to get it as deep as you can, huh? CDR CC Let's go as deep as we can in the orange. CDR The bottom will be 44 (*74001*) and the top will be 35 *(74002).* LMP CC And I'm not sure whether your pan will look down into the crater or not, Jack. But if it didn't, we'd like to get another one from there. CDR It did. I'll also get you a stereo pan before we leave.

> Yes. I've practiced too long on taking stereo pans of craters, without getting one here. What is that

LMP Yes. Right, and it's on both sides. LMP OH, it's a piece of glass, probably. Boy, it sure is. You know that we just about got to the upper edge of this little ellipsoid zone. I think we've messed up most of it. Let's try right over here. I've got a little piece of glass in my pocket *(74235).* The upper portion of the core is going to be a little bit disturbed, because we've walked around the area so much. There was a little piece of black glass - - solid black glass. I'll get a shot. Take your picture. That's about as far as I can shove it. Was the gray mantle over the top of this, or was this showing all the way through to the surface. No, it was over the top. It was about a half a centimeter over the top. He's getting about 3 centimeters a whack. Very good. I'll tell you, it's a lot harder going in than that double core back there. It's pretty hard. It acts like it's inherently cohesive. It breaks up in angular fragments. An essential portion of the zone actually has a crimson hue, or red hue. Outside of that, it's orange. And outside of that it is gray. I'm going up to the max here for just a minute or two. OK, Let me hit it some more. Ready? Have at it. He's still getting a centimeter a whack, poor guy. I better get a locator. The only thing I question is our ability to get it out. Man, that's really hit bottom. Pull slowly. Slowly so I can cap it all right. Let me get a cap. OK, very slow. Even the core tube is red! The bottom one's black – black and orange, and the top one's gray and orange! The fact is, the bottom of the core is very black compared with anything we've seen. Hey, we must have gone through the red soil because it's filled, but it's filled with a black material. Dark stuff, almost a very fine grained - That might be magnetite. God, it is black isn't it?

right there?
