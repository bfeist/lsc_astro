## **Introduction**

The trench dug near Van Serg Crater (figures 1 and 3) was 17 cm deep, with upper 2 cm (79220), next 5 cm (79240) and bottom 10 cm (79260). The material below the surface was light colored (see transcript). Numerous rocks can be seen in the surface photos, and several were collected with the soil samples.

The soil samples of this trench have been used to understand the color differences due "space weathering" (Noble et al. 2001, Taylor et al. 2001a, b). Darker soils are more mature.

## **Petrography**

The maturity of 79261 is Is /FeO = 43 and the average grain size is 90 microns (Morris 1978, Graf 1993). The surface sample, 79221, has an index of 81 and average grain size of 60 microns (very mature) and 79241 has an index of 51. (In any trench activity there is the chance that some of the surface material has slumped into the trench). The percentage agglutinates

CDR Jack, you ought to get a scoop of that dirt, though. LMP Well, there's one scoop - - . Look what's underneath it. It's white.

CDR Well, I wanted to be sure we got some of those small glass balls.

LMP Yes, we'll get a scoop of it. Upon the top.

LMP Come here, Gene, quickly. We can't leave this. This may be the youngest mantle ever – whatever was - -

CDR Take pictures of it. I don't have any film.

LMP - was thrown out of the craters.

CDR What Jack has done is he dug a trench in the southwest – northeast direction, and he discovered about 3 inches below – 4 inches below the surface – a very lightgray material. Take that crust.

LMP I'm trying to get the upper portion there. There we go. The first 2 cm, bag 483 (79220). The next 5 (cm) in 484 (79240).

CDR Get some?

LMP I got quite a bit. And the next 10 cm of the lightgray material, probably in 485 (79260). A possibility here is that this upper 6 inches of gray material in here is the latest mantling in the area and the light-colored debris may be what's left over from the impact.

CC We've had a change of heart here again as usual, and we are going to drop station 10 now that we've hurried you so much, and we'd like to get a double core here. And we'd like you to get some football-sized rocks while you are doing that - -

LMP You don't want a double core here. I don't think we can do it, now. It's too rocky.

CDR You don't think we'll get through that stuff you just trenched?

LMP Well, I'm afraid there are rocks all through it.

CDR Let's try it. I've got it started (79002).

## **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of the three soils from this trench are slightly different (tables 1 – 3), but not such that it would explain the color difference.

The high maturity of the soil samples from this trench is confirmed by the carbon and nitrogen contents (figure 5). Moore et al. (1974) determined 150 ppm carbon for 79221, 140 ppm C for 79241 and 110 ppm C for 79261. Goel et al. (1975) found 111 ppm nitrogen for 79221, 118 ppm N for 79241 and 78 ppm N for 79261. Clayton and Thiemens (1980) reported 91 ppm nitrogen for 79221 (figure 8).

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

O'Kelley et al. (1974) determined the cosmic-rayinduced activity of 22Na = 165 dpm/kg, 26Al = 130 dpm/kg, 46Sc = 65 dpm/kg, 48V = 30 dpm/kg, 54Mn = 215 dpm/kg, and 56Co = 470 dpm/kg for surface soil 79221 and 22Na = 43 dpm/kg, 26Al = 45 dpm/kg, 46Sc = 15 dpm/kg, 54Mn = 44 dpm/kg, and 56Co = 26 dpm/ kg for trench bottom 79261.

## **Other Studies**

Jordan and Heymann (1975) studied the rare gas content and isotopic ratio of different grain size separates from different depths in the trench at Van Serg Crater. Clayton and Thiemens (1980) found that there were more than one sources of nitrogen (figure 8).
