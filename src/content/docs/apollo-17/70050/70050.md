# 70050

# BSLSS Residue

2223 grams

#### Introduction

70050 is the residue from the large BSLSS bag and is made up of many fragments off of several rock samples (Butler 1973). This sample contains chips off of the loose rock samples and well as soil that was adhering to them when they were collected. 79035 was a very friable soil breccia, which was found broken in rounded pieces in the BSLSS, so one can assume that much of the residue is from this rock. The Teflon bag containing 76335 must have spilled, because a large number of distinctive white pieces of this anorthosite were also found in the residue of the BSLSS (some were renumbered). The other large coherent samples in this BSLSS were found broken, giving evidence that the BSLSS had been handled roughly, somewhere along its return.

This sample has been sieved and various pieces were assigned to the rock they clearly came from.

#### **Petrography**

For some incomprehensive reason, this sample is better characterized by rare gas analysis than by any petrography (Bogard et al. 1974). There were 57 grams of 4-10 mm coarse-fines in this bag (Meyer 1973).

The BSLSS (EVA #3) contained large loose rocks 70017, 70215, 76055, 77035 and 79035. It also contained the core tube 70012 and two bags of documented samples (70075 and 76335).

70053, was a "picking pot" for coarse fines.

### **Chemistry**

Rhodes et al. (1974) reported an analysis which was intermediate between highland and mare (figure 1). However, it is meaningless, because the material was derived from only a few rocks.

#### **Other Studies**

This sample was used for physical measurements (Talwani et al. 1974).

# **Processing**

It is reported that the Apollo 17 BSLSS was found sitting in  $\frac{1}{4}$  in. of water for up to 10 hrs. after the CM was retrieved (Butler 1973, pages 38 and 39). The outer bag was replaced and it was flown to Houston where it was outgassed in a dry  $N_2$  cabinet. After 4 days, the  $O_2$  pressure was low, but the  $H_2O$  pressure was still high.

note: I can not find pictures of this bag
