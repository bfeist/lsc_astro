## **Introduction**

77537 is a rake sample from station 7, Apollo 17. It appears to be another impact melt rock, but there are no thin sections nor other allocations. It has zap pits on all sides (figures 1 – 3).

### **Petrography**

Keil et al. (1974) and Meyer (1994) gave brief descriptions of 77537. It is coherent without fractures and has10-20% vesicles ranging in size from <1 mm up to 15 mm. Clasts are difficult to discern.

Based on comparison with other samples from this location, this rock is an impact melt rock.

#### **Chemistry**

None
