## **Introduction**

79115 and 79135 were sampled from a boulder on the rim of Van Serg Crater, station 9, Apollo 17. 79115 is from the top surface of the boulder and 79135 was from beneath 79115 (see transcript and figure 3).

The amazing thing about this sample is that it contains the same orange glass beads, of volcanic origin, that were found at station 4! Fruland (1983), Simon et al. (1990) and others have shown that 79135 and 79115 are regolith breccias with a seriate grain size distribution, some agglutinates, high gas content and a

wide range of lithic components. The exposure age was found to be about 800 m.y.

79115 has not been well studied – perhaps because it appears to be so similar to 79135. However, it contains at least two large white clasts (figure 2)

## **Petrography**

Fruland (1983) and Simon et al. (1990) included 79135 in their initiative to study regolith breccias. 79135, and its companion 79115, are coherent dark matrix breccias, but they are highly fractured with two sets of fracture planes that cause these samples to readily breakup into large and small rhombs (figures 1 and 2). The dark glassy matrix is spotted with numerous white inclusions. The maturity index for 79115 is Is /FeO = 56 (Jerde et al. 1987).

McGee et al. (1979) described 79135 as follows: "sample 79135 is a fragmental matrix breccia characterized by disperse populations of mineral, lithic and glass clasts in a homogeneous matrix of mineral debris and partially to completely devitrified opaque glass". Porosity is about 5 %.

Butler (1973) and Neal and Taylor (1993) discuss 79135 in their catalogs.

CDR That looks like a breccia right there in front of us.

LMP Yes. There's some interesting patterns on the surface.

- -

LMP OK, Gene's tearing apart one of the very intensely fractured rocks. And it comes off in small flakes. Let's get this one, because this will be the best oriented one of the documentation, plus why don't you get that one you've got from the inside there?

CDR Yes, I am.

LMP Bag 568 is a fragment from the surface. That's a corner, I think, of the block that Gene documented here.

CDR Yes, it is.

LMP We'll get another sample – that'll be from the inside the block.

CDR Get it with this real easy. Here's a whole big – we ought to take that just as is.

LMP Put a bag around one end if you can Here the other end is smaller.

CDR That's breccias, too. Se the white fragments in there? It's got a lot of very small -

LMP It looks like this big one over here. You know, it might be that these might be pieces of the projectile. I don't know. Because it doesn't look like – it's not subfloor. Well that's wrapped in – if you put it end down, it might stay in the bag.

CDR I doubt it. It's 480, and it's relatively tabular shape, and it's about 10 inche long.

LMP And it's highly friable. It breaks apart, in small chips.

### *Glass*

Haggerty (1974), Chen et al. (1982), Delano and Lindsley (1983) and Shearer et al (1991) studied the abundant orange glass spheres in 79135. There are also other glasses. Much of the glass is devitrified.

## **Chemistry**

Simon et al. (1990), Baedecker et al. (1974), Rose et al. (1974), Rhodes et al. (1974), Philpotts et al. (1974),

Wanke et al. (1974) and LSPET (1973) reported analyses of 79135 (table 1). Jerde et al. (1987) found essentially the same composition for 79115 (table 2). Both 79115 and 79135 have high Ni, Ir and Au. Zn is also high in 79135.

Moore et al. (1974) determined 150 ppm carbon (figure 9). Becker and Epstein (1981) also determined a similar amount of carbon. Norris et al. (1983) reported 143 ppm C and 45 ppm N. Gibson and Moore (1974) determined 1020 ppm S. Gibson et al. (1987) included 79135 in their attempt to study hydrogen distribution.

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Church and Tilton (1975) and Nyquist et al. (1974) reported the Pb and Sr isotopes of 79135, respectively, but no age data is obtained from this.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Hintenberger et al. (1974, 1975) determined the exposure age of 79135 as 810 ± 60 m.y. by the 21Ne method.

## **Other Studies**

Clayton and Thiemens (1980) and Norris et al. (1983) studied the nitrogen isotopes in 79135 (figure 8) and Becker and Epstein (1981) studied the carbon isotopes.

Reese and Thode (1974) reported the composition of sulfur isotopes.

Pearce et al. (1974) and Cisowski and Fuller (1983) reported the magnetic properties of 79135.

Hintenberger et al. (1974, 1975) and Wieler et al. (1983) studied the rare gas content and isotopic composition of 79135. Heber et al. (2001) studied He distribution.

Gold et al. (1976) determined the dielectric constant.

## **Processing**

79135 was too big for the Teflon bag it was brought back in and part of it was sticking out. There is a lot of residue in SCB#5 and some of it may be from 79135. There are 21 thin sections of 79135 and 7 thin section of 79115.
