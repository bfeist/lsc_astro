### **Introduction**

Breccia sample 76035 was picked up near a small boulder located about 20 meters east of the big station 6 boulder. This small boulder also rolled down from an outcrop high up on the North Massif (Wolfe 1981).

### **Petrography**

Chao et al. (1975) stated that 76035 was similar to 77115 and to 72435. Ryder (1982, 1984) found that 76035 had microphenocrysts of olivine in the matrix and was different from the samples of the large station 6 boulder.

Figure 1 shows that the main mass of 76035 is bluegray impact melt breccia typical of the highlands, figure 2 shows the other side has an assemblage of light and dark clasts folded together as in an omelet (Meyer 1994). Note the large clast in figure 1.

### **Chemistry**

None

### **Radiogenic age dating**
