# **Introduction**

70170 is the bag residue for breccia sample 70175 (Butler 1973). According to Wolfe et al. (1981) this sample was collected about 5 m south of the deep drill site at the ALSEP site (figure 1).

# **Petrography**

The soil has not been studied, probably because it may contain fragments of 70175 which is described as a "glass-rich microbreccia" (Neal and Taylor 1992).

# **Chemistry**

The composition of this soil has not been measured, but it should be similar to that of 70181.
