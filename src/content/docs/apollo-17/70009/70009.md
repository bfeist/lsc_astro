- 4 22 11 CDR Man, it didn't feel like this stuff was this hard. See if I can get it out. I may be jacking the treadle down into the surface. Come on baby. I'm going to get this thing out, now that I got it. I hope this core is appreciated. Man, I don't know what it's in.
- 4 22 15 LMP I was afraid that would happen with all this rocks.
- 4 22 15 CDR Yes, but it didn't go in that hard.
- 4 22 27 CDR I've got a delicate core in one hand, and I'm trying to get some core caps on the other. You'd be glad to know it's full, Bob.

**Introduction**  page 2

The Apollo 17 deep drill was collected with great difficulty at the ALSEP site near Camelot Crater and within an area of many small craters known as the Central Cluster (figure 2). The drill core is a continuous section of the top of the regolith, 3 meters long, that represents an historic achievement *(and much appreciated by the science community)*. Drilling the lowest 20 cm was very difficult, because the basal material was very cohesive. Extraction was also very difficult, although for this mission it was facilitated by a specially designed "treadle". A neutron probe was successfully inserted into the open hole (figure 1). Two surface soils were collected nearby – 70180 and 70160.

The drill core "string" for Apollo 17 was broken down and returned in three segments (70009, 70008, 70007) (70006, 70005) and (70004, 70003, 70002, 70001) in a special beta-cloth bag. Apparently the plug inserted into the top of the drill did not function, because a void (10 – 12 cm) was found at the junction of 70008 and 70007 (which were not tightly connected) and core material slid along the core. Indeed, the transcript shows that the crew had difficulty placing the plug in the top of the core and ramming it home. However, it is believed that core recovery was ~100% (Duke and Nagle 1976).

The Apollo 17 deep drill core is not homogeneous along its length. It varies in nuclear track density, maturity, agglutinate content, modal mineralogy and in chemical composition. Vaniman et al. (1979) subdivide the drill string into 5 units A – E (bottom to top), while Taylor et al. (1979) subdivide it into 8 units A – H (top to bottom). The most obvious feature is a relatively coarse layer of immature mare material from about 22 cm to about 71 cm depth (called unit D by Vaniman et al. and unit B by Taylor et al.). *(This confusion can be attributed directly to the editors of the 10th Proceedings; Bogard, Horz and McKay)* 

As soon as the drill string was returned to Houston, it was broken down into sections and a small amount was extracted from the tops of the bottom six segments to be put in a freezer where they have been kept cold all these years – see essay titled **70001**.

#### **Interpretation**

The data from the Apollo 17 deep drill core has been studied in detail by numerous investigators, who each give it their own interpretation based on their particular

technique (Taylor et al. 1979, Morris et al. 1979, Vaniman et al. 1979, Goswami and Lal 1979). A synthesis of these models is given in Langevin and Nagle (1980) and McKay et al. (1992).

Arvidson et al. (1977) make the connection between a site-wide "event" about 96 m.y. ago and the deposition of the deep drill core as part of a slab at about 100 m.y. (Curtis and Wasserburg 1975). Drozd et al. (1977) determined that many of the features at Apollo 17 (including the Central Cluster) can be dated at 109 ± 4 m.y. which they associate with the crater Tycho.

Fruchter et al. (1979) found that the Apollo 17 deep drill core had lower than expected values of 26Al and 53Mn at depth (figures 12 and 13) proving that there had been a recent crater at this location, which was filled in recently with previously irradiated surface material.

However, careful nuclear track studies indicate a long exposure and multiple episodes of deposition (Goswami and Lal 1979). A layer at about 240 cm is found to have a high dose of 15N and 21Ne indicating an ancient exposure to the sun (Thiemens and Clayton

1980). Everyone agrees that the top 22 cm has been gardened by micrometeorite bombardment.

#### **Petrography**

A description of 70001 can be found in the Lunar Core Catalog (1976) pages 17-32 to 17-36. It was 5.5 cm long and was dissected top to bottom (0.5 cm at a time). Each unit was sieved into >1mm, 1-0.125 mm and <0.125 mm. A bottom portion (70001,5; 3.43 g) was placed in deep freeze! Descriptions of 70009, 70008 and 70007 are given by Duke and Nagle (1976). 70005 is described in newsletter #18. During dissection as many as 54 lithologic units were identified, but Nagle and Waltz (1979) eventually grouped these into 6 major units. These descriptions were soon superseded by petrographic study of thin sections.

Housley et al. (1976) showed that the maturity along the length of the deep drill is given by the proportion of agglutinates (figure 3) and the ferromagnetic resonance measurement Is/FeO (figure 4). Vaniman et al. (1979) tabulated the modal abundance of components for different size ranges, concluding that the Apollo 17 deep drill core was made up of 5 distinct units (see table). *"The upper unit E (0-22 cm depth) is marked by high content of fused soil, brown glass, and mare fragments. The underlying unit D (22-71 cm depth) has a low abundance of fused soil (i.e. low maturity) and is rich in coarse (>200 micron) mare fragments. A large section of the core, unit C (71-224 cm depth), is finer-grained, more mature (richer in agglutinates), more feldspathic and has more highland lithic, mineral and glass fragments than unit D. The next underlying unit, B (224-256 cm depth), has yellow/* 

*colorless KREEP glasses with a high-Si, low-alkali composition unlike the common Apollo 15 or Apollo 17 KREEP series. The deepest unit, A (256-284 cm depth), is marked by its relatively higher maturity and lower yellow/colorless KREEP glass content".* This description is an excellent starting point for a discussion of the core. However, Taylor et al. (1979) see a different set of layers, Morris et al. (1979) have found that the whole lower part of the drill string is mature to submature and Goswami and Lal (1979) have identified various units and events based on careful analysis of nuclear tracks. Thus there is no consensus on where the major subdivisions should be, but it is clear that the core is not well mixed (McKay et al. 1992).

Near the bottom of the core Vaniman and Papike (1977c) found fragments of very-low Ti (VLT) basalt, which is otherwise rare at the Apollo 17 site.

The coarse layer near the top (22 to 71 cm) is the least mature Apollo soil (only 6% agglutinate, Taylor et al. 1979) and is made up of coarse fragments and minerals of ilmenite basalt (Vaniman et al. 1979).

#### **Mineralogical Mode**

Detailed mineralogical modes based on petrographic analysis of thin sections were determined by Heiken and McKay (1974), Taylor et al. (1977), Vaniman and Papike (1977b), Taylor et al. (1979) and Vaniman et al. (1979). A summary of the mineralogical mode is given in Vaniman et al. (1979).

Glass: Warner et al. (1979) reported the composition of glass from the top of the drill core. Vaniman et al.

(1979) reported that a lot of siliceous KREEP glass is to be found in their unit B (224-256 cm).

#### **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of the deep drill core has only been measured in gross detail (it is a long core). The main features found so far are a variation in TiO2 content with depth (figure 7) and an enrichment in trace elements (especially the fines) at about 240 cm (figures 8, 9 and 10).

Ehmann and Ali (1977) measured the top of the core (70009 – 70007). They and others found there to be an abundance of Ti- and Fe-rich basalt in 70008.

Helmke et al. (1973), Laul et al. (1979) and Vaniman et al. (1979) each found a trace-element enriched layer at a depth of about 240 cm. Laul et al. found that the

![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)

*Figure 5: Chemical composition of deep drill samples for Apollo 17 compared with composition of all lunar soils.* 

trace-element-enriched material (KREEP?) was especially enriched in the finest fraction (figure 10).

Laul et al. (1984) found that Zn was anticorrelated with agglutinate content. Zn was highest in the fine fraction indicating that it was surface correlated (figure 11).

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

The irradiation history and depositional history of this deep drill core is complicated. The material in the core with the least, and most ancient, surface exposure is near the surface (25 to 60 cm deep), and the soil with the greatest, and most recent, surface exposure is at a depth of 110 – 170 cm. The top 25 cm is like other soils at Apollo 17 (Thiemens and Clayton 1980). However, a region around 240 cm has correlated high 15N, 21Ne, 38Ar and KREEP content. It needs to be studied in more detail.

Curtis and Wasserburg (1975) studied the neutron fluence of the core using Gd isotopes, consistent with a model where the core was laid down at a single, recent time (~100 m.y.). However, in a later paper they reported a single particle that has Gd isotopes inconsistent with that model (figure 17).

Rancitelli et al. (1975) and Fruchter et al. (1976 - 9) reported 22Na and 26Al for the entire Apollo 17 deep drill core. Nishiizumi et al. (1976) reported the activity of 53Mn for samples of 70008 and Fruchter et al. (1979) determined the whole core (figures 12 and 13).

#### **Other Studies**

Rare gas contents were reported by Pepin et al. (1975) who found an enrichment of 21Ne and 38Ar at depth

![](_page_4_Figure_11.jpeg)

(figure 14). Elevated 15N was reported by Thiemens and Clayton (1980) for about the same region. This indicates a long exposure to the Sun at an ancient time.

Crozaz et al. (1974), Crozaz and Plachy (1976), Crozaz and Dust (1977), Crozaz and Ross (1979), Goswami and Lal (1977 and 1979) studied nuclear tracks in silicates as a function of depth (figures 15 and 16). This data indicate a complicated exposure of particles along the core and is consistent with a long, multi-event deposition of the core.

#### **Processing**

Although the core was allowed to sit in the sunlight (see figure 1 in 70180), and was warmed up for 7 – 10 days during transit to earth, portions were removed and placed in a freezer, where they have remained all these years (see section on 70001).

Continuous sets of thin sections and long epoxy encapsulated reference cores are available for the entire drill string (eight segments).
