## **Introduction**

Sample 72375 was collected from the top of boulder 2, at station 2, Apollo 17 (figure 2). The top surface is rounded and covered with patina and zap pits, while the bottom surface is freshly broken (figure 1 a, b). according to Wolfe et al (1981), boulder 2 represent "bedrock" from high up on the South Massif. There appears to be a thick, brown, "patina" on all the samples from this boulder (unstudied).

## **Petrography**

Dymek et al. (1976) found that all the samples from this boulder were alike. It has not been as "wellstudied" as the others. See sections on 72315, 72335, 72355, 72395. Mineral analyses can be found in Dymek et al. (figure 4).
