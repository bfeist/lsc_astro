## **Introduction**

Lunar sample 72275 is a friable feldspathic breccia with an aphanitic matrix and several important clasts (figure 1). It was collected from the top of a layered boulder (#1), located within a landslide from the South Massif at the Apollo 17 site (Marvin 1975, Schmitt 1975) and is generally thought to represent ejecta from the Serenitatis basin (Dalrymple and Ryder 1996) (however, see evidence to the contrary in the paper by Morgan et al. 1975). The boulder may have rolled down the slope of the South Massif after the emplacement of the landside, but there are no boulder tracks visible today so it is difficult to tell where exactly it came from (Wolfe 1975).

72275 was specifically collected from boulder 1, because it appeared to be representative of the matrix of the boulder. It was found that the chemical composition of 72275 matrix had higher trace element content than for the other three samples of this boulder (figure 2). This sample has a wide variety of clast types

derived from the lunar highlands (Stoeser *et al.* 1974, Ryder et al. 1977, Salpas et al. 1987, 1988). It has a high trace element content due to a high abundance of KREEPy non-mare basalt. It doesn't contain any of the high-Ti mare material from the valley floor and is

not a regolith breccia. The matrix and many of the clasts contain significant Ir and Au contents indicating meteorite contamination. It is clast rich and somewhat akin to the Apollo 14 breccias.

This sample has a breccia-in-breccia texture where clasts of darker microbreccia are included in the light feldspathic matrix (figure 4). The major mineral in the matrix is feldspar. The darker areas have a higher percentage of fine matrix to clasts (Willis 1985). Portions of the light friable matrix of sample 72275 are very porous (5 to 30 percent).

The first slab cut from 72275 was the object of study by the "Consortium Indomitabile" (John Wood, leader). Two additional slabs were cut from 72275 for the "breccia-pull-apart" study led by Larry Taylor (Salpas et al. 1985). Ryder (1993) provided a comprehensive review of all aspects of 72275. Recently, Nemchin et al. (2008) dated 18 zircons from 72275 ranging in age from 4.24 to 4.37 b.y., while another zircon from this boulder was found to be as old as 4.417 b.y. (Nemchin et al. 2009).

## **Petrography**

72275 is a polymict breccia with about 60% light porous matrix and 40% clasts. The majority of the clasts are dark aphanitic microbreccia, but also include non-mare basalt and feldspathic, plutonic fragments of the lunar crust. The light matrix of 72275 is a porous aggregate of angular mineral and lithic fragments ranging in size up to 0.1 mm (Marvin 1975). Calcic

feldspar (An ) is the dominant mineral phase. The 92-98 compositions of olivine and pyroxene mineral fragments in the matrix are given in figure 4.

The dark grey aphanitic clasts are dense and themselves microbreccias (see clasts 2 and 3 below) and equivalent to the majority of the material in the other samples of the boulder (72215, 72235, 72255).

A light colored zone through the sample is made up almost entirely of crushed non-mare basaltic material. The non-mare basalt clasts are fine-grain pigeonite basalts (equivalent to KREEPy basalt), with about equal amounts of pyroxene and plagioclase (figure 10).

There are a number of other rock types present in the clast population of 72275 including: ilmenite micrograbbro, pink spinel troctolite basalt, granulitic feldspathic clasts and at least one ferroan anorthosite (otherwise rare for Apollo 17) (Ryder et al. 1975, Salpas et al. 1988). Some of the larger clasts were analyzed and are discussed individually below.

#### **Clast 1** Marble Cake Clast (,566)

The very prominent clast known as the "Marble Cake Clast" (seen in figures 6 and 27) is 3 cm in size with cataclastic gabbroic anorthosite and other material crudely interlayer with grey breccia and trace-elementrich, dark rim material (figure 7). The white core material is a mix of anorthositic norite, ilmenite micrograbbo, granite and other small lithic fragments with various textures. These are swirled with vesicular glass as if lightly stirred in a marble cake (Ryder et al. 1975). The black rim of the Marble Cake clast (,80) has the composition of KREEP basalt (Blanchard et al. 1975). Nunes and Tatsumoto (1975) found that their split of the marble cake clast plotted well off of the U/ Pb discordia line defined by the other boulder samples.

#### **Clasts 2 and 3** Dark gray aphanitic clasts (,42)

These large (1 cm?) dark aphanitic clasts are seen in figures 5 and 6. Blanchard et al. (1975) found that clast 2 (,83) had a trace element pattern similar to KREEP, but Morgan et al. (1975) determined 3.44 ppb Ir (non pristine). Leich et al. (1975) obtained an Ar release pattern, but could not determine the age.

#### **Clast 4** Pigeonite Basalt (,170)

Pigeonoite basalts (later termed KREEPy Apollo 17 basalts) have equal amounts of pyroxene and plagioclase and are trace element rich. Compston et al. (1975) and Nunes and Tatsumoto (1975) studied

the same pigeonite basalt (there is some confusion as to which clast this is). Compston et al. obtained an isochron age (figure 15).

#### **Clast 5** Pigeonite Basalt (,91)

Blanchard et al. (1975), Morgan et al. (1975) analyzed another pristine clast of pigeonite basalt (figure 12). Ryder et al. (1977) and others have studied these nonmare basalts in detail and determined their mineralogy (figure 10). Unlike the Apollo 14 and 15 non-mare basalts, the "pigeonite basalts" in 72275 do not have orthopyroxene cores. Leich et al. (1975) determined

an Ar release plateau, but were not able to determine an age.

#### **KREEP basalt clasts**

Ryder (1977) and Salpas et al. (1987) describe several KREEP basalt clasts, several of which had a subophitic basaltic texture (figure 9). They equate these to the KREEPy pigeonite basalt clasts previous studied. A large number of these clasts, including two with pristine igneous texture, were analyzed by Salpas et al. (1987). Shih et al. (1992) were able to obtain one of the brecciated KREEP basalt clasts and date it by both Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd (figures 16 and 17).

#### **Ferroan Anorthosite Clast** (,350)

A unique fragment of pristine ferroan anorthosite was studied by Salpas et al. (1988). It was 3 x 4 x 5 mm and composed of 95% plagioclase (An96) and 5% pyroxene (figure 12). The chemical composition is given in table 2 and this clast is apparently plutonic and pristine (Ir<2 ppb). Since this is what we think the lunar crust was made of, we are surprised to not find more fragments of this kind in the ejecta of large impacts.

#### **Granulitic ANT Clasts**

The Consortium Indomitabile coined the acronym ANT for the small fragments of plagioclase-rich, potash and phosphorous-poor rocks whose mineralogies vary over the range anorthosite-norite-troctolite (*never mind the otherwise small grain size*). In 72275 the textures of these feldspathic clasts are that of an annealed granulite (figure 12). Salpas et al. (1988) discovered several that were large enough to analyze (table 2, figure 13). However, they were all high in Ir.

## **Granite Clast**

Meyer et al. (1996) featured a large coase-grained granite clast on the cover of meteoritics (figure 30).

## **Mineralogy**

The mineral fragments in the matrix are, in order of abundance: plagioclase, olivine, orthopyroxene, pigeonite, Ca-rich clinopyroxene, ilmenite, spinel, cristobalite, barian K-feldspar, Fe metal, troilite, zircon and armalcolite (Stoeser et al. 1974).

## **Chemistry**

Chemical analyses of the matrix of 72275 are given in table 1 and of selected clasts in table 2. In addition there are a number of analyses of small clasts in thin

section by broad-beam, electron probe microanalyses in the papers by Ryder et al. (1975) and Stoeser et al. (1975). Salpas et al. (1987, 1988) present the analyses of a large number of clasts (mostly KREEP basalt and granulitic feldspathic clasts (ranges shown in figure 13).

The composition of the light matrix of 72275 is broadly similar to that of the pigeonite basalt clasts (Salpas et al. 1987). There is a hint of slightly elevated Al, which would be expected by the presence of anorthositic clasts.

The trace siderophile element ratios (Morgan et al. 1975) are not exactly what is expected for Serenitatis ejecta. Ge is very high, and there is evidence that this is from the high KREEP component (which is itself surprisingly high in Ge).

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Compston et al. (1975) and Shih et al. (1992) found that the age of the KREEPy basalt clasts in 72275 to be about 200 m.y. older than the ages of KREEP basalts from Apollo 15 (such as 15382, 15386). Nunes and Tatsumoto (1975) attemped to date various chips of 72275 for the consortium by U-Th-Pb, but learned instead that the breccia and its clasts has suffered extensive movement of Pb. Leich et al. (1975) also attempted to obtain Ar-Ar dates, but found that plateau ages were ill defined except for one case. *(please note that dates reported here are the original data and require correction for new decay constants) Figure 17: Sm-Nd isochron diagram for*

## **Other Studies**

Pearce et al. (1974), Brecher et al. (1974) and Banerjee and Swits (1975) determined the magnetic properties of 72275. Housley et al. (1977) included 72275 in their study of ferromagnetic resonance of lunar samples (it had none).

(1977) have reported the spectra. Goswami and Hutcheon (1975) and Goswami et al. (1977) studied the track densities in minerals from 72275. Charette and Adams Nemchin et al. (2008) and Grange et al. (2009) have dated numerous zircons extracted from the sawdust of 72275 and other rocks.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Leich et al. (1975) determined the exposure age of 72275 and other samples of the same boulder by a number of techniques, of which 81Kr are the most reliable (figure 18). The conclusion is that 72275 (from the top of the boulder) has been exposed to cosmic rays for 52.5 ± 1.4 m.y.

## **Processing**

72275 is friable and broke into pieces on the return to Earth (figure 1). A partial slab (,42) was cut to expose the prominent clast for the Consortium Indomitabile in 1974. This saw cut was completed and two additional slabs were cut for the Larry Taylor "brecciapull-apart" project in 1984. A partial "flow diagram" of processing of 72275 is provided. A piece of 72275 is on public display at the Langley Research Center in Virginia.

There are 110 thin sections of 72275. Some are used in the educational thin section packages; many are of the clasts that have been extracted from the slabs.
