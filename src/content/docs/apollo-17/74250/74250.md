## **Introduction Petrography**

74250 and 74270 are residual soil samples returned in These bag residue have not been studied. Lunar bags with basalt samples 74255 and 74275. They are samples are always covered with dust which from the rock outcrop near the orange soil at Shorty becomes residue in sample bag – along with pieces Crater (figure 1). rubbed off of the rock sample included. The basalt samples in these bags were discussed in the catalog by Meyer (1994) and this compendium.
