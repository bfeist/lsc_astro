#### **Introduction**

Sample 70019 was collected from within a fresh, 3 meter, glassy-lined crater located near the Lunar Module (figures 2 and 3).

70019 could be consider as an example of a large "agglutinate" made up of pieces of regolith breccia cemented together with black glass (figures 1 a,b and 10).

*Note: Numerous investigators (e.g. Greenwood and Heiken 1970; Wilshire and Moore 1974; See et al. 1986) have shown an interest in glass from small, fresh craters in the lunar regolith and it is rather disappointing that they haven't honed their interested by studying this particular large glass object1*

#### **Petrography**

Fruland (1983) and Simon et al. (1990) included 70019 in their study of regolith breccias from Apollo. It is made of two major components – dark, coherent microbreccia fragment and black shiny glass. The microbreccia has a seriate grain size distribution with glass matrix and glass inclusions (figure 4 a,b). Simon et al. (1990) found that the matrix was 60% (figure 5) and that agglutinates were abundant (figure 6). Typical orange glass is also abundant. Pearce and Chou (1977) also described 70019.

## *Glass*

The glass in 70019 has been the object of several studies. Fredriksson et al. (1974) and Mao et al. (1975) reported analyses, while Klein and Uhlmann (1976) and Uhlmann et al (1979) used the glass in 70019 to discuss viscosity of molten glass on the Moon. Sato 1976) and Mao et al. (1975) discussed the reduction of iron in glass in 70019.

### **Chemistry**

Rhodes et al. (1974), Wiesmann and Hubbard (1976), Pearce and Chou (1977), Wanke et al. (1976) and Simon et al. (1090) all obtained similar results (table 1). It has the composition of the soil in the area of the LM (figure 8, 9). Jovanovic and Reed (1975) also reported P, Cl, F and other elements.

Petrowski et al. (1974) determined 142 ppm C, 70 ppm N and 999 ppm S, Norris et al. (1983) reported 116 ppm C and 70 ppm N and Becker and Clayton (1975) reported 60 ppm N (figure 9). Filleux et al. (1977, 1978) reported surface abundances of carbon of ~ 170 ppm. Liech et al. (1974) studied H and F on the surface. It all depends on what part of the sample you study (figure 10)!

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Keith et al. (1974) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 22Na = 110 dpm/kg, 26Al = 45 dpm/kg, 54Mn = 166 dpm/kg, 56Co = 240 dpm/kg and 46Sc = 59 dpm/ kg. Fruchter et al. (1978) determined 26Al = 52 dpm/ kg and 54Mn = 245 dpm/kg. and calculated that this was about 85% saturated.

#### **Other Studies**

Nunes et al. (1975) and Church and Tilton (1975) determined U, Th, Pb and Pb isotopes in 70019.

Grossman et al. (1974) showed that the isotopic composition of oxygen in 70019 was on the fractionation line for the Earth and Moon.

Becker and Clayton (1975) and Petrowski et al. (1974 reported an abundance of 4 He, but other rare gas studies that could give us the exposure age are lacking.

Sugiura et al. (1979, 1980) studied the magnetic properties of 70019. Pearce and Chou (1977) tried to obtain the direction of magnetic field using the glass, but the orientation of the sample on the lunar surface was not documented. They found that the magnetic

properties of the glass were similar to those of the breccias (figure 11).

#### **Processing**

There are 12 thin sections of 70019. Most of the thin sections were from only one lithology (figure 10). 70019 was chipped, not sawn.
