Sample 76295 was chipped from block 1 of the big Massif. The interpretation is that this boulder was part boulder at station 6 (figure 1; Wolfe et al. 1981; Heiken of the ejecta blanket from the gigantic impact that et al. 1973; Meyer 1994). Tracks made by this broken produced the Serenitatis Basin.

This important boulder was observed to be made of three lithologic units (76295 is from unit C). 76295 is a non-vesicular, crystalline matrix breccia with a bluegrey color (similar to 76275). Light and dark clasts have a distinct outline with the matrix (figure 2). The B1 surface has zap pits, while the N1 surface is freshly broken. The other surfaces of the rock were covered with a "buff powder" and/or "patina" (Heiken et al. 1973).

The fine grain texture and overall clast/matrix texture of 76295 and 76275 were important evidence for the thermal model developed by Simonds (1975) and Onorato et al. (1976) for the genesis of impact melt breccias. Briefly, this model is that hot impact melt entrained, and was quickly cooled, by cold clastic debris that was partially digested. The resulting melt sheet then crystallized to a fine grain matrix including undigested mineral and lithic clasts.

### **Petrography**

Sample 76295 has been described by Heiken et al. (1973) and Simonds (1975) as a fine subophitic impact melt. It is a banded, clast-bearing, nonvesicular, bluegrey breccia with aphanitic matrix. The blue-grey breccia matrix contains bands and swirls of minor (~10%) tan matrix breccia and partially dissolved mineral and rock clasts. A slab sawn from the breccia (,12) and the other saw cuts illustrates the "marbled" texture of the tan and blue-grey breccia matrix (figure 11). Four individual rock clasts have been studied by Simonds (1975, McGee et al. 1977).

### *Significant Clasts*

*Dark grey:* Subophitic melt rock similar to matrix. Table 1, figure 8.

*Light grey:* Poikilitic melt rock similar to 76015. Table 1, figure 8.

*Porous Basalt Clast:* Similar to a basalt clast in 76015. Simonds (1975) Table 1, figures 5, 8.

*Troctolite Clast* (feldpathic olivine norite): Monomict breccia. Simonds (1975), Phinney (1981) Figure 6.

The matrix of 76295 is holocrystalline with only minor void space. The mode is about 50% plagioclase and 40% pyroxene with minor ilmenite, olivine and other

minerals. Grain size of matrix feldspar is <15 microns, pyroxene 10-25 microns.

Norman et al. (1993) have compared the compositions of minerals in LKFM clasts in 76295 with minerals in similar clasts in 76315 and conclude that the clast population in 76295 is dominated by "Mg-suite norites, troctolites and gabbronorites". Minor-element abundances in both olivine and pyroxene are unlike those found in lunar rocks of the ferroan anorthosite suite.

### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Olivine is generally Fo67-78 (Norman et al. 1993; Simonds 1975).

*Pyroxene:* The composition of pyroxene and olivine is shown in figure 4 – 6.

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase is generally in the range of An (Norman et al. 1993). 81-97

*Zircon:* Meyer found one large rounded zircon in the matrix of 76295 (figure 9).

*Metal:* Misra et al. (1976) studied the nickel-iron particles in 76295 (figure 7).

## **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of the blue-grey and tan matrix portions of 76295 were found to be identical (table 1; figure 8). Unpublished data can be found in Simonds and Warner (1981) and Phinney (1981). Higuchi and Morgan (1975) found that the matrix samples of 76295 were tightly grouped within meteorite group 2 on an Ir-Au-Re diagram, but that clasts extracted from 76295 had different ratios (figure 10).

The composition determined for the porous basalt clast was "unusual".

*Note: There appears to a mistake in the tabulation of data from Higuchi and Morgan (1975) for 76295 matrix in Simonds (1975).*

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Cadogan and Turner (1976) determined the crystallization age of two samples of 76295 by the 39Ar 40Ar plateau technique. The tan matrix yielded an intermediate temperature plateau age of 3.95 ± 0.04 b.y., and the blue grey matrix yielded and age of 3.96 ± 0.04 b.y. However, both sub-samples exhibited

appreciable decreases in 40Ar over the last 30% hightemperature release (figure 14).

Unpublished elemental and isotopic data for U, Th and Pb by Leon Silver and Rb-Sr by Larry Nyquist were reported in Phinney (1981).

A large zircon in 76295 has been dated at ~4.25 b.y. (with 4.12 b.y. overgrowth) by the ion probe method (Pidgeon et al. 2006; Nemchin et al. 2010) (figures 9 and 12).

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Data from radiation counting is given in Heiken et al. (1973) (table 3). Unpublished isotopic data for He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe by as determined by Bogard are found in Phinney (1981).

O'Kelley et al. (1974) determined the cosmic-rayinduced activity of 26Al = 67 dpm/kg., 22Na = 54 dpm/ kg, 54Mn = 38 dpm/kg, 56Co = 41 dpm/kg. and 46Sc = 5 dpm/kg. Rancitelli et al. (1974) determined 26Al = 71 dpm/kg, 22Na = 64 dpm/kg, 54Mn = 69 dpm/kg, 56Co =35 dpm/kg,

### **Other Studies**

Gose et al. (1978) propose that the large scatter of magnetization direction of 76295 implies the predominance of pre-impact magnetization in this sample. Brecher (1976) makes convincing argument that alignment of magnetization follows the direction of foliation and is caused by "textural remanent magnetization".

### **Processing**

Sample 76295 was one of the samples studied by the Station 6 Boulder Consortium led by Bill Phinney. A detailed guidebook of the results of this consortium is available from the Curator (Phinney 1981). Lithological maps of the boulders and of the samples are presented in a Tech Report by Heiken et al. (1973). The sketch in figure 13 shows the approximate location of the saw cuts for initial processing of 76295. The map of slab (,12) reproduced in figure 11 shows the tan lithology is surrounded by the more abundant bluegrey lithology.

There are 19 thin sections.
