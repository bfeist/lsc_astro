highlands material (ANT for anorthosite, norite and troctolite). Somehow, the original group of researchers thought the large knob in this sample had the appearance of a "dying dog" – and it was so named.

This sample of boulder #1, station 2, was smaller than the others and was studied less intensively, waiting for results of the study of other samples (72215, 72255, 72275) before final allocation (*which apparently never happened*). Most of the studies are of a serial set of thin sections (,28) and preliminary allocations from an adjacent slab (,29).

## **Petrography**

Graham Ryder (1993) summarized the earlier studies of the Consortium Indomitable (led by John Wood and Ursula Marvin). Stoeser et al. (1974) and Ryder et al. (1975) describe 6 microscopic "domains" within the thin sections and give broad-beam electron microprobe analyses (figure 3). Briefly, domains 2 and 6 are the dark "rind" of the layered knob, which is non-porous, clast-poor and very fine grained (impact melt). Domain 1 is outside the rind and separated by a sharp contact from it. Domain 1 was apparently an anorthosite, before it was crushed and fragmented. Domain 3 is a monomict breccia of feldspathic granulite. Domain 4 is a complicated polymict breccia of mixed lithic clasts of highland material and vesicular crushed matrix. Domain 5 is a thin layer of monomict noritic material – about 75% plagioclase, 25% pyroxene and trace Mgspinel.

# **Significant Clasts KREEP Norite (C1)**

*Figure 5: Normalized rare-earth-element composition diagram for matrix and gabbroic clast in 72235 (data from Blanchard et al. 1975).* 

Stoeser et al. (1974), Ryder (1993) describe a 3 mm clast found in 72235,28 as a KREEP norite. It has a mode of about half plagioclase (K-rich) and half pyroxene (figure 4). It was found in the center of the "dying dog" knob (see figure). It has not been analyzed.

#### **Granite clasts**

The abundance (5 -20%) of small (5-100 micron) patches of high-silica, high-K,Ba feldspar intergrowths in 72215, 72235, 72255 and 72275 make boulder 1 from station 2, Apollo 17, unique among lunar samples (Ryder et al. 1975). These are mostly located in the darker portions.

#### **GA clast ,36 ,37**

Blanchard et al. (1975) and Morgan et al. (1975) analyzed white material from the interior of the "dying dog" knob and found that it was feldspathic (table 1, figure 5). However, it had very high Ir (17 ppm) and must itself be a breccia (or contaminated). It may be part of domain 3 (Stoeser et al. 1974) and is crushed gabbroic anorthosite (GA).

### **Chemistry**

Fruchter et al. (1975), Blanchard et al. (1975), Morgan et al. (1975) and Stoeser et al. (1974) analyzed the matrix and other portions of 72235 (table 1). Obviously, it was difficult, at best, to obtain unmixed materials, as each lithology is intruded by portions of the adjacent lithology.

### **Processing**

Ursula Marvin has documented the subdivision of the "dying dog" clast in appendix A of the Consortium Indomitable. Briefly, in 1974, a slab (1.5 cm) was cut through the middle of the "dying dog" knob and a column was cut in the middle of the slab. A suite of thin section was made from an adjacent piece.
