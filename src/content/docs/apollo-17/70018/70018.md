## **Introduction**

Sample 70018 was collected near the Lunar Module, probably from one of the glass-bottom craters mentioned by the astronauts (Wolf et al. 1980). It was brought back as a "loose rock" in SCB1. There are probably more pieces of it in the residue of this bag (71010).

It has not been studied.

### **Petrography**

The photos of 70018 show that it is a coherent regolith breccias with white clasts in a black matrix. It has a thin glass coating whish is reported to have a few zap pits (Butler 1973).

A one large while clast outcrops on the T1 surface (figure 1).
