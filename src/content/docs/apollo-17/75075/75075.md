### **Introduction**

75075 was found lying loose on top of a large boulder. It is substantially different in composition from the other basalt samples from Camelot Crater, such that it is believed to have been from a different lava flow from 75055 etc. (Wolfe et al. 1981). Figure 1 shows that 75075 is a very vuggy ilmenite basalt (up to 20% by volume).

The crystallization age of 75075 is 3.74 ± 0.02 m.y. with an apparent old exposure age of 143 m.y. Although it has an old exposure age, and was found on top of a boulder, it doesn't appear to have many micrometeorite craters. The exposed surface has a pronounced, smooth patina instead (figure 2).

### **Petrography**

Figure 3 shows the interior texture of 75075. The texture is described as subvariolitic to subophitic (Neal and Taylor 1993). The average grain size is 1-2 mm, with plagioclase and ilmenite forming the larger crystals. Mineral chemistry has not been reported, but it is noted that there is no interstitial glass. Roedder and Weiblen (1975) reported low-K melt inclusions in ilmenite. Vugs in 75075 are 2 – 20 mm in size and interconnecting (figure 1).

Usselman et al. (1975) used experiments to show that 75075 cooled at about 1 deg/hr. O'Hara and Humphries (1975) used 75075 to experimentally determine the early formation of armalcolite. Muan et al. (1974) determined the phase relations.

*Note: Pictures show that there was a mysterious red patch on the exterior surface (probably orange soil). The original PET catalog (Butler 1973) mentioned a "burnt sienna" color!* 

### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* A small amount of olivine is found in cores of pyroxene grains.

*Pyroxene:* Jagodzinski et al. (1975) demonstrated the presence of exsolved pigeonite in augite cores.

*Armalcolite:* Neal and Taylor (1993) describe armalcolite in 75075 as a discrete phase, sometimes mantled by ilmenite.

### **Chemistry**

The chemical composition is given in table 1 and figures 4, 5 and 6. Paces et al. (1991) classify 75075 as a type B A17 basalt (figure 6). Gibson et al. (1976) determined 1700 ppm S for 75075. Liech et al. (1974), Jovanovic and Allen (1974, 1980) and Allen et al. (1977) studied F, Cl and P concentrations in 75075.

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Nyquist et al. (1975) and Murthy and Coscio (1976) obtained the Rb/Sr age for 75075 (figures 8 and 10). Lugmair et al. (1975) determined the Sm – Nd age by

internal mineral isochron (figure 9). Jessberger et al. (1975) and Horn et al. (1975) determined the age by Ar/Ar, with plagioclase being the most reliable (figure 7). Chen et al. (1978) carefully studied the Pb isotopes in 75075, but were unable to obtain age information by this technique. They concluded that there may have been a disturbance in the U – Pb system about 2.8 b.y., suggesting Pb loss by volatility in the temperature range 400 – 900 deg C.

### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

The 38Ar exposure age is 118 m.y. (Horn et al. 1975), based on the most reliable plagioclase separate. Lugmair et al. (1975) reported 143 ± 5 m.y. as determined by 81Kr and 144 m.y. by 38Ar. This is older than the apparent age of Camelot Crater (~80 m.y.) as determined from 75035 and 75055 (see discussion in Arvidson et al. 1976).

### **Other Studies**

Mayeda et al. (1975) reported the isotopic composition of oxygen for various mineral separates. Petrowski et al. (1975) determined carbon and sulfur isotopes. Chen et al. (1978) performed interesting experiments with Pb isotopes (see above).

Lugmair et al. (1975) reported the isotopic composition of Xe, Kr, Sm and Nd.

Horn et al. (1975) used 75075 to investigate the effects of recoil on Ar/Ar ages.

### **Processing**

This rock was chipped, not sawn. Neal and Taylor (1993) discuss the analysis of 75075 in their re-catalog. Although a large number of thin sections were distributed, no mineralogical results were forthcoming for this rock.
