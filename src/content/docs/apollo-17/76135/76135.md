CDR We're at Turning Point Rock. I don't know if it's mantled on top, but it's certainly filleted. There's lots of the dark mantle up and on the slope of the shallower slopes of the boulder. And it's on little mound itself, as if much of it might be covered up. LMP Yes. It looks like a breccia from here.

CDR Can you get a sample of it right here? You see these little chips?

LMP Yes, I probably can.

CDR It's 3 meters from turning point rock on the east side - -

LMP Can you drive up to the – right there, let's see – no, I can get them. The thing is I don't know what it is.

CDR Well, but - -It's part of these fragments around here. I guess Turning Point Rock is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 meters high anyway. I'd say it's a very rough subrounded typoe of rock – by the face – let me get this Jack. Okay. There are two fragments in that sample.

- - - LMP Bob, it looks – it's very coarsely vesicular; but, at first glance, it did not look like the pyroxene gabbro – althouh the rock – that rock does. It looks like it migh be fragmental, althoug I'm suspicious that I'm looking at zap pits.

LMP Bob, my guess, right now, is that Turning Point Rock is a big piece of subfloor gabbro.

CC OK. I gather you changed your opinion.

#### **Introduction**

- —

Breccia sample 76135 and basalt sample 76136 were collected near Turning Point Rock at station LRV-10 (figure 1). This boulder is different from the main station 6 boulder. It may have also rolled down from an outcrop high up on the Massif, or, as the LMP concludes, it may just be a piece of valley basalt. LRV-10 was at the break in slope of the North Massif and the Valley floor.

To dated, 76135 has not been carefully studied, nor dated.

#### **Petrography**

Agrell and Reid (in Butler 1973) described 76135 as a "vesicular micronorite." They noted that it was hollocrystalline and that it apparently had two generations of vesicles (figures 3, 4 and 5).

Meyer (1994) described 76135 as a "vesicular, clastbearing, poikilitic impact melt breccia."

Chao et al. (1975) state that "76135 may be similar to 76055". However, it is lighter in color and more vesicular.
