#### **Introduction**

Lunar sample 70017 is a vesicular, medium-grained, high-Ti basalt that was collected from the area near the Lunar Lander (figure 1). It was one of the last rocks collected from the moon and the astronauts made a speech about it referring to "the children of the world". Subsequently, small pieces of it were distributed widely. It has also been the subject of many science investigations (briefly summarized below).

70017 has a crystallization age about 3.7 b.y. and an exposure age about 220 m.y.

#### **Petrography**

Longhi et al. (1974) describe 70017 as "a mediumgrained hypidiomorphic granular high-Ti basalt with textural relations suggesting relatively slow cooling. Large, equant, subhedral grains of clinopyroxene (1-2)

mm) enclose embayed ilmenite (figure 3). Plagioclase (up to 2 mm) is anhedral and poikilitically encloses clinopyroxene, olivine and ilmenite. Cristobalite is present in interstices between clinopyroxene, plagioclase and ilmenite."

Roedder and Weiblen (1975) studied melt inclusions in ilmenite in 70017 and other Apollo 17 rocks and found evidence for silicate liquid immisibility.

Nord et al. (1974) determined that 70017 had a single-stage cooling history (<2 deg./hr.), by carefully studying the defect structure of pyroxene and plagioclase. Usselman et al. (1975) also calculated the cooling rate.

# **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Olivine (Fo<sub>66-69</sub>) is found in the cores of the large clinopyroxene grains and in plagioclase (figure 4).

**Pyroxene:** Pyroxene is abundant in 70017. Large pyroxene grains are zoned from subcalcic augite to pigeonite to Fe-rich (figure 6). Pyroxene cores contain up to 3.5% TiO<sub>2</sub> and 4.5% Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (Brown et al. 1973, Hodges and Kushiro 1974 and Longhi et al. 1974). Sung et al. (1974) studied the ratio of <sup>3+</sup>Ti/<sup>4+</sup>Ti in pyroxene – perhaps 30% is <sup>3+</sup>Ti!

*Plagioclase:* Longhi et al. (1974) measured plagioclase as An69-88.

*Opaques:* Ilmenite is abundant and found occuring in long "chains" (figure 2). It has exsolution of chromite and rutile (figure 5). Experiments show that armalcolite was an early phase, but it has mostly converted to ilmenite. Some relict armalcolite is found in pyroxene cores (figure 7). Small grains of chromite are reported in olivine (Hodges and Kushiro 1974). El Goresy and Ramdohr (1975) studied the opaque minerals in 70017 in order to determine the nature of subsolidus reduction

producing elemental iron. Analyses of armalcolite in 70017 are given in table 2.

*Silica:* Silica found in 70017 is cristobalite (Hodges and Kushiro 1974, Roedder and Weiblen 1975) and has a characteristic cracked texture (figure 8).

*Mesostasis*: A very complex mesostasis of glass, silica, troilite-iron, whitlockite and trace tranquillityite occurs in this rock.

# **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of 70017 is given in table 1 and figures 9 and 10. It is typical of the other basalts returned from Taurus-Littrow (figure 11) and is classified as a group B basalt (Paces et al. 1991). The chemical composition of high and low K melt inclusions is found in Roedder and Weiblen (1975).

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Nyquist et al. (1975) and Schaeffer et al. (1977) have dated 70017 at 3.67 b.y. Note that the "ilmenite separates" are found to contain the most Rb (figure 12). The "ages" determined by Phinney et al. (1975) and Mattinson et al. (1977) were not convincing. Tilton

and Chen (1979) also reported U/Pb data for 70017. Additional isotopic data is found in Unruh et al. (1984).

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Phinney et al. (1975) determined an exposure age of 220 ± 20 m.y. for 70017.

Yokoyama et al. (1974) report that 70017 was apparently saturated with 26Al.

# **Other Studies**

Rutherford et al. (1974) studied the "liquid line of decent" for the cooling of a basalt with the composition of 70017 and found experimental evidence for "liquid immisibility". Sato (1976) determined the *insitu*  oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature (figure 13).

Petrowski et al. (1974) determined the concentration and isotopic composition of sulfur and carbon. Mayeda et al. (1974) reported the isotopic composition of oxygen.

Huffman et al. (1974) measured the Mössbauer spectra of 70017 (figure 14) and determined the amount of metallic iron (0.1%). Brecher et al. (1974), Nagata (1974), Stephenson et al. (1974) and Schwerer and Nagata (1976) studied the magnetic properties of 70017.

Hapke et al. (1978) and Osborne et al. (1978) used powered rock samples of 70017 to calibrate spectra that might be obtained from orbit.

Neal and Taylor (1993) provide an extensive review of the work done on 70017 in their catalog. Sixty-four thin sections were prepared from 70017. Thin sections of this rock are featured in the Lunar Petrographic Educational Thin Section Set (Meyer 2003).

Small pieces of this rock were given to many countries of the world (70017 has been called the "children of the world rock"). A piece of this rock is on public display at the Virginia Air and Space Center, Hampton Virginia (figure 16).
