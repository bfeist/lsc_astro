## **Introduction**

70135 was collected from Geophone Rock, along with other smaller pieces (70136 to 70158) (figure 3). Geophone Rock was about 3 meters high and was

located at the ALSEP station about 150 m from the LM. It is a vesicular high-Ti basalt typical of the Apollo 17 site with a crystallization age of about 3.7 b.y. and an exposure age of about 110 m.y.

Part of the interest in Geophone Rock was that it was expected that it would be covered with the mysterious "dark mantle", but the astronauts were unable to recognize such (see transcript).

## **Petrography**

Brown et al. (1975) and others described 70135 as "plagioclase-poikilitic" (figure 4). Small olivine grains are found poikitically enclosed in pyroxene and plagioclase. Rare armalcolite is found poikitically enclosed in pyroxene. Roedder and Weiblen (1975) studied the silicate melt inclusins found trapped in ilmenite. Metallic iron and troilite are found in the mesostasis.

LMP Bag 10 echo (70135) is a sample of a very large boulder that's just beyond geophone 3. It's the same kind of rock I saw near the LM – and the Gabbro – I'm beginning to lean towards 50% plagioclase, though. I see no clear alignment of plagioclase or pyroxene in it. That's the one with the parting in it. It looks as if – integrating what I've seen here and over at the big rock – the geophone rock – that the layering or the folliation or the parting, whichever it is, is the result of variations in vesicle concentrations. The sapmle 10 echo (70135) is a sample of the more coarsely vesicular rock. I could not get one of the finer – more finely or nonvesicular fragments. But I got pictures of it.

Neal et al. (1989) and Neal and Taylor (1993) reported on the mineralogy and petrography of the smaller samples from this same basaltic boulder.

## **Mineralogy**

*Pyronene:* Although mineral chemistry for 70135 is unknown, Neal et al. (1989) and Neal and Taylor (1993) reported pyroxene compositions of some of the smaller fragments (summarized in figure ) that were also sampled form Geophone Rock.

*Opaques:* El Goresy and Ramdohr (1975) studied the subsolidus reduction of ilmenite and chromite. Analyses of metallic iron are not given.

*Rutile:* El Goresy and Ramdohr (1975) gave analyses of rutile in 70135 (table 4) and noted that Zr was enriched. Neal et al. (1989) also reported rutile in 70138. It apparently forms by exsolution form early formed ilmenite.

## **Chemistry**

Rhodes et al. (1976), Laul et al. (1974), Rose et al. (1975), Shih et al. (1975), Korotev and Haskin (1975), and Dickinson et al. (1989) found videly variable results (table 1). Something is wrong (figure 7). Either the samples included the soil seen attached in figure 1, or there was a mistake in sample numbers. Korotev and Haskin (1975) discussed the sample size limitations. The only satifactory resolution would be to prepare a large clean sample, and create a powder for carefully planned analyses.

Ma et al. (1979) and Neal et al. (1990) analyzed the smaller fragments also chipped from Geophone Rock (table 2). These analyses were consistent, and may give the best value for Geophone Rock. It is interesting

to note that classification of these basalt samples varied from type A to type B!

Gibson et al. (1976) reported 1680 ppm sulfur in 70135. Jovanovic and Reed (1975 on) reported on halogens, Ru and Os.

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Nyquist et al. (1975, 1979) dated 70135 by Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd internal mineral isochrons (figures9 and 10). Paces et al. (1991) reported an age for 70139 from the same rock, as well as whole rock data for 70138 (also from Geophone Rock).

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Cosmic-ray induced activity of 22Na = 33 dpm/kg., 26Al = 38 dpm/kg., 54Mn = 56 dpm/kg, 56Co = 56 dpm/kg. and 46Sc =32 dpm/kg. was determined by radiation counting of 70135 (O'Kelley et al. 1974). Interestingly this high activity could be traced to intense bombardment by solar wind protons on Aug 4-9, 1972, prior to the Apollo 17 mission.

The exposure age by 81Kr was reported as 106 m.y. by Arvidson et al. (1974).

## **Other Studies**

Brecher (1977) and Cisowski (1983) reported on the magnetic properties of 70135. This magnetic data is interesting in light of the reduced iron found in this rock.

## **Processing**

A small slab (1 cm thick) was cut from one end of 70135 (figure 11). There are 10 thin sections.
