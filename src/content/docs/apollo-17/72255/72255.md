## **Introduction**

Lunar sample 72255 was collected from the side of a layered boulder #1 at station 2 located on the bottom slope of the South Massif and within the landslide material at Apollo 17 Taurus-Littrow (Schmitt 1973, Wolfe et al. 1981). Samples 72215, 72235 and 72275 are from other layers in this boulder and soils 72220, 72240 and 72260 are from the fillet surrounding the boulder (figure 1, section 72215). The boulder had a prominent layering with clasts weathering out as knobs. 72255 was one of these knobs and was from a distinctly different layer than 72275 (which is otherwise vaguely similar).

Sample 72255 is a clast-rich breccia with a layered aphanitic matrix (figure 1). The age of the matrix of this rock is ~ 3.8 b.y. It contains a large relic norite clast (Civet Cat) with an age of ~4.08 b.y., and also contains various small clasts of silica-rich, "granitic" material. It also contains numerous zircons ~ 4.2 b.y. (Nemchin et al. 2008).

The cosmic ray exposure age of 72255 has been determined to be about 44 Ma.

Wolfe et al. (1981) and others interpret this boulder to be part of the Serenitatis ejecta blanket, originally located high up on the South Massif. However, based on subtle, but reproducible, differences in the ratios of trace amounts of meteoritic siderophile elements, Morgan et al. (1975) conclude that the samples of *"this boulder cannot represent ordinary Serenitatis ejecta",*  and may instead *"represent Serenitatis material excavated from the fringes of the crater during late stages of the Serenitatis impact, but only slightly shocked and hence uncontaminated by the Serenitatis projectile*".

## **Petrography**

Graham Ryder (1993) carefully summarized what is known about this rock. It was originally studied in consortium mode by a large group of scientists led by John Wood called "Consortium Indomitable" (Marvin et al. 1975) – of which Graham was an original member.

Knoll and Stoffler (1979) described 72255 as having a dark, fine-grained, equigranular crystalline matrix that contains some areas of lighter, coarser-grained matrix. Stoeser et al. (1974) reported that the sample was about 60% matrix and gave a lithologic mode for the clast

population. Simonds et al. (1974), Spudis and Ryder (1981), Ryder (1993) and others conclude that 72255 is an aphanitic impact-melt breccia.

## **Significant Clasts**

## **Civet Cat Norite clast** (~ 10 grams)

This 2 cm sized clast (figures 1 and 2) is a pristine shocked, norite with about 40% plagioclase and 60% orthopyroxene with minor augite lamellae (Stoeser et al. 1975, Ryder and Norman 1979). It has a cataclastic texture with light and dark streaks. Some of the plagioclase in the light streaks is maskelynite, and the pyroxene has "kink-bands". Ryder et al. (1975), Stoeser et al. (1975) and Bersch et al. (1993) analyzed the

minerals and found that they were homogeneous (figures 7 and 8). The rare-earth-element pattern is given in figure 9. It was dated by Ar/Ar at 3.99 b.y. (figure 11) and Rb/Sr at 4.08 b.y. (figure 14). Based on low siderophile element content (Morgan et al. 1975), Warren (1993) declared it "pristine" (lacking meteoritic siderophiles). James (1982) and James and Flohr (1983) grouped the Civet Cat Norite with the

Mg-norites on the basis of both chemistry and mineralogy.

#### **Granite clasts**

As is typical of the matrix of 72215, the matrix of 72255 also has abundant small (~25 micron to 2 mm) patches of "granitic" material with different textures. Typically it is intergrown silica with Ba-rich K-spar and some plagioclase. Often it contains ternary feldspar.

### **Poikilitic Impact Melt clast**

Ryder (1992) reported a fragment of poikilitic impact melt within 72255 that was distinct in texture from the matrix. This clast (,287) is reported to be about 7 mm in size, have mm sized oikocrysts of pigeonite (En<sub>82-70</sub>) and "rather more high-Ca clinopyroxene" than the common Apollo 17 poikilitic boulders. Both plagioclase chadocrysts and pyroxene oikocrysts are said to be chemically zoned. It was uncovered during the cutting of the second slab and has been dated by Dalrymple and Ryder (1996). However, complete description is not available.

## **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of the matrix of 72255 was determined by Keith et al. (1974), Fruchter et al. (1975), Palme et al. (1978), Blanchard et al. (1975) and others (tables 1 and 2). It is high in  $Al_2O_3$  (~20%) and the trace element pattern is that of KREEP (figure 6).

The composition of the clasts that have been extracted is given in Table 3 and figure 9.

Morgan et al. (1975) and Higuchi and Morgan (1975) found that the trace meteoritic siderophile elements (Ir, Re and Au) have different ratios for samples form this

boulder, as compared with other boulders at Apollo 17 and elsewhere. They concluded that boulder 1, station 2 was Serenitatis ejecta, *albeit strange*.

## Radiogenic age dating

Leich et al. (1975) determined an age of  $4.01 \pm 0.03$  b.y. for the matrix (,52) and an age of  $3.99 \pm 0.03$  b.y. for the Civet Cat norite clast (,42) (figures 12 and 11). On the other hand, Compston et al. (1975) also dated the Civet Cat norite clast by internal Rb/Sr isochron technique (figure 14) and obtained an age of  $\sim 4.08$  b.y. (corrected to modern decay constant for Rb). However, they noted a hint of "disturbance". Schaeffer et al. (1982) found a wide variety of ages by Ar-Ar laser probe analysis of small spots (mostly plagioclase). Dalrymple and Ryder (1996) determined a number of Ar/Ar plateaus on different lithologies (figures 13 and 15), but generally found the same result as Leich et al. (1975). They interpret their age for the youngest material as the age of the Serenitatis Impact (3.84 b.y.).

Nunes et al. (1974) collected U-Pb data, but it is difficult to interpret. Hutcheon et al. (1974) determined an age of a whitlockite grain (81 ppm U) of ~3.9 b.y. by the fission track method!

## Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages

The cosmic-ray induced activity for 72255 was determined by Keith et al. (1974) as <sup>22</sup>Na = 61 dpm/kg., <sup>26</sup>Al = 78 dpm/kg., <sup>46</sup>Sc = 6 dpm/kg., <sup>54</sup>Mn = 41 dpm/kg., and <sup>56</sup>Co = 35 dpm/kg.

Leich et al. (1975) determined an exposure age of 44.1 ± 3.3 m.y. from <sup>81</sup>Kr data and 41 m.y. from <sup>38</sup>Ar data.

This is less than the exposure age of samples form the top of the boulder (e.g. 72275), probably because of shielding effects. Arvidson et al. (1976) speculate that this might be the age of Tycho!

#### **Other Studies**

Rare gas data for 72255 can be found in Leich et al. (1975). There does not seem to be a significant solar wind component, so there is little or no ancient regolith admixed into this boulder.

(1975) studied the magnetization including paleointensity and direction. Macdougall et al. (1974), Hutcheon et al. (1974), Goswami and Hutcheon (1975) and Goswami et al. (1976) have studied cosmic-ray induced nuclear particle track densities, complicated by shock alteration and erosion and spallation (figure 10).

### **Processing**

The original subdivision of the first slab was well documented by Consortium Indomitable (Vol. 1, Appendix A). There is additional material from the Civet Cat Norite clast available in the second slab (,226), but the CCN clast did not continue through the second slab (Mosie 1985). There are 31 thin sections of 72255.
