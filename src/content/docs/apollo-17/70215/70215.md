## **Introduction**

*Did you ever want to reach out and touch the Moon? Here's your chance.* Lunar sample 70215 is a dense, fine-grained porphyritic mare basalt that has been used to create "touchstones" for public display (see list under Processing). It was collected about 60 m from the Lunar Module and is one of the largest stones returned from the Moon.

Neal and Taylor (1993) catalogued 70215 as a "high-Ti, Mare Basalt" and it contains an abundance of ilmenite (~13%). Although it has been dated by Kirsten and Horn (1974) at 3.84 ± 0.04 b.y., the Apollo 17 basalts average in age around 3.72 b.y.

70215 was found sitting on the surface and has micrometeorite craters on all faces, proving that it has "tumbled" during its residence on the lunar surface. It contained small vugs with projecting plates of ilmenite and pyroxene (figure 1). 70215 has been used for numerous scientific experiments, including experimental petrology, physical properties and magnetic properties. A sizeable portion of the rock remains available for additional studies.

## **Petrography**

Wilshire (in Apollo 17 Lunar Sample Catalog), Longhi et al. (1974), Dymek et al. (1975), Brown et al. (1975), McGee et al. (1977) and Neal and Taylor (1993) gave various descriptions of 70215. It has variously been termed a "fine-grained, subvariolitic basalt", "spherulitic, fine-grained high-Ti basalt", "Type 1A, Apollo 17 high-Ti basalt", "fine-grained porphyritic basalt" and "medium dark gray, fine-grained basalt". Walker et al. (1976) and McGee et al. (1977) noted that there were distinctly different textural regions in thin sections of 70215. Walker et al. simply termed these "grainy" and "fuzzy" regions and noted a slight (but significant) variation in bulk composition. The contact between the regions is gradational, but can be seen in thin sections ,145 and ,147. Both regions contain a small amount of irregular pore space and rare vesicles 0.05 to 0.1 mm in diameter. Figure 2 shows the texture of one region. The reason for a variation in texture (and composition) in this rock has not been explained.

McGee et al. (1977) describe the finer-grained region consisting of "phenocrysts of olivine and ilmenite in a groundmass of fan-shaped intergrowths of plagioclase and pyroxene. The olivine displays a variety of shapes

including elongate, hollow prisms (0.1x0.4 to 0.2x0.8mm), equant and subequant grains (0.1-0.3mm) and skeletal, euhedral phenocrysts (0.1-0.3mm). Ilmenite phenocrysts occur as equant grains (0.4mm) and as laths (0.6-2.0mm) with irregular jagged edges which commonly contain cores of armalcolite and lamellae of rutile." The matrix contains minute (0.3mm) "bow-tie" intergrowths of plagioclase and pyroxene along with needle-like laths of ilmenite. Olivine phenocyrsts contain small octahedra of Crulvöspinel.

McGee et al. (1977) describe the coarser-grained region consisting of "equal size olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts (0.3-0.8mm) set in a matrix consisting of feathery to acicular intergrowths of subparrallel

plagioclase and pyroxene crystals. Olivine phenocrysts are epitaxially overgrown with pyroxene. Rare anhedral grains of plagioclase are present. Skeletal laths of ilmenite (0.01-0.08mm) are commonly arranged in parallel sets which display optical continuity. Lamallae of rutile are common in ilmenite." Troilite and native iron occur in the matrix.

At low pressure, olivine and armalcolite were the first phases to crystallize during cooling of the 70215 lava (figure 6). On further cooling, these first-forming phases partially reacted with the melt to form clinopyroxene and ilmenite (figure 5). Rapid cooling apparently prevented early plagioclase nucleation, with Ca and Al being used up in the pyroxene, before plagioclase finally joined the crystallization sequence

(Dymek et al. 1975). Mesostasis contains silica (4%) and K-rich glass.

Neal et al. (1990) updated the chemical classification of Apollo 17 basalts originally proposed by Rhodes et al. (1976) and classified 70215 as type high-Ti, B2 (see figure 10). It can be related to other Apollo 17 basalts by fractional crystallization in the source region and/ or near surface fractionation of olivine, Cr-spinel and/ or ilmenite (Walker et al. 1975).

## **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Olivine phenocrysts in 70215 show the effect of "rapid crystallization, being poorly formed, hollow, and skeletal in habit" (Dymek et al. 1975). Olivine (Fo ) contains only minor amount of "trace 75-65 elements".

*Pyroxene:* Pink pyroxene typically occurs as reaction rims on olivine. It is high in Ca (Wo37-44) and in minor elements (Al, Ti, Cr). Groundmass pyroxene is more iron rich (figure 3).

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase in 70215 is found as intergrowths with Fe-rich pyroxene, often in 'bowtie' spherulite textures. It is relatively sodic An86-80 (figure 4).

*Armalcolite:* Rare armalcolite is found in cores of large ilmenite (figure 5).

*Ilmenite:* Ilmenite replaced armalcolite by reaction with the melt. Muhich et al. (1990) reported variations in ilmenite composition, partially due to rutile exsolution.

*Cr-ulvöspinel:* Cr-ulvöspinel occurs as small octahedra in olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts (Dymek et al. 1975).

## **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of 70215 has been determined by LSPET (1973), Rhodes et al. (1974), Shih et al. (1975), Wanke et al. (1975), Duncan et al. (1974), Rose et al. (1974), Masuda (1974), Dickinson et al. (1989), Brunfelt et al. (1974) and Morgan et al. (1974)(Table 1). The high TiO2 content (~ 13 wt. %) is typical of Apollo 17 basalts (figure 7). The light REE are significantly depleted (figure 8) indicating that the source region was already evolved (Shaffer et al. 1990). Figure 10 uses the Ba/Rb raito and Sm content to distinguish between type A and type B basalts and showing that 70215 is type B.

Gibson et al. (1974, 1975, 1976), Moore et al. (1974) and Petrowski et al. (1974) reported 2210, 2040 and 1689 ppm S (respectively); Garg and Ehmann (1976) reported 214 ppm Zr and 6.8 ppm Hf; Hughes and Schmitt (1985) reported 6.2 ppm Hf; Muller (1976), Moore and Lewis (1976) and Goel et al. (1975) reported 3, 88 and 20 ppm N (respectively); and Moore and Lewis (1976) reported 31 ppm C. Eldridge et al. (1974) reported U, Th and K contents of 70215,4. Merlivat (1974, 1976) determined hydrogen and deuterium. Reese and Thode (1974) reported sulfur (1581 ppm) and sulfur isotopes.

## **Radiogenic age dating**

Nyquist et al. (1976) tried to date 70215 by Rb-Sr, but couldn't obtain a wide enough spread in Rb-Sr to obtain an age. Kirsten and Horn (1974) determined a Ar/Ar plateau age of 3.84 ± 0.04 b.y. (corrected to 3.79 b.y.)(figure 9). However, type B basalts are 3.69 b.y., while Apollo 17 basalts taken together appear to be 3.72 b.y. (Paces et al. 1991) so that the old Ar/Ar age for 70215 seems anomoulous. Schaeffer et al. (1977) used a laser to obtain numerous Ar/Ar ages of minerals and intergrowths in 70215 ranging from ~3.6 b.y. for olivine to ~3.8 b.y. for intrgrowths. Thus, 70215 still needs to be dated and initial isotope ratios better defined.

#### **Summary of Age Data for 70215**

Ar/Ar

Kirsten and Horn 1974 3.84 ± 0.04 b.y. Schaffer et al. 1977 3.63 -3.85

**Note: old decay contant** 

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Kirsten and Horn (1974) determined a cosmic ray exposure age of 100 ± 12 m.y. with the 38Ar and Drozd et al. (1977) reported a Kr-Kr exposure age of 126 ± 3 m.y. which they attribute to the age of Camelot Crater.

## **Other Studies**

Longhi et al. (1974), Kesson (1975), Green et al. (1975), O'Hara and Humphries (1975) and Walker et al. (1976) attempted to determine the depth of origin of high-Ti basalts by performing high pressure experiments on 70215 and synthetic compositions (figures 11-14). The slight variation in starting composition, along with experimental details, led to considerable discussion (see Walker et al., Kesson and Ringwood 1976).

The remanent magnetism of 70215 was studied by Runcorn et al. (1974), Nagata et al. (1974), Schwerer and Nagata (1976), Pearce et al. (1974), Sugiura and Strangeway (1980), Hargarves and Dorety (1975), Cisowski et al. (1977), Collinson et al. (1975) and Stephenson et al. (1974, 1975) (figure 19).

Mizutani and Osako (1974) determined seismic wave velocities as a function of pressure of 70215. They also reported thermal diffusivities. Warren et al. (1974) and Tittman et al. (1975, 1976 and 1978) studied the effect of adsorbed volatiles upon the attenuation of ultrasound in 70215. Ahrens et al. (1977) used pieces of 70215 to study the shock compression alteration of the dynamic properties of the lunar surface.

## **Processing**

Sample 70215 broke into two subequal pieces (,3 and ,4) (figure 15). Two slabs were cut from ,4 (figures 16-18) leading to many allocations. There are a total of 25 thin sections, 5 touchstones and three displays. The Constellation "display" is also a touchstone and is being used to "promote" ISRU on future lunar expeditions.
