LMP OK. A piece of that spalled rock that was sitting by the gnomon – watch out Gordon. How about that? – is in bag 535 (76215)

#### **Introduction**

76215 was collected from the lunar surface right next to the large Station 6 Boulder, but it was most certainly recently spalled from the top of block 4 of Boulder 6 (Wolfe et al. 1981), where there is a fresh mark that fits the sample directly above the location where the sample was found on top of the soil (figure 1). It is a sample of lithologic unit B of the big boulder and is similar in color, texture, composition and age to 76015 chipped from the top of adjacent boulder half.

76215 is a crystalline matrix breccia with a mostly poikilitic texture, but there are some areas that have an ophitic texture characteristic of crystallized (basaltic) melt. It has been dated at 3.94 b.y., with an exposure to cosmic rays for 19 m.y. and has an aluminous composition with high trace element content. It contains high concentrations of meteoritic siderophiles and is thought to be impact melt from the Serenitatis impact.

There is a large area on 76215 that has a surface coating, called patina, with variable thickness from top to bottom, which has not been eroded by bombardment by micrometeorites.

#### **Petrography**

Simonds (1975), McGee et al. (1977), Phinney (1981), and Meyer (1994) give descriptions of 76215. It is a vesicular, crystalline matrix breccia with a crude macroscopic foliation defined by the alignment of vesicles and cavities, including the roughly flat side of a large cavity that defines one side of the sample (figure 8). Over 90% of the matrix is poikilitic made up of a network of coalescing pigeonite and augite oikocrysts (0.5 to 2 mm) which enclose abundant tabular plagioclase chadocrysts (10-30 microns). Olivine occurs as irregular chadocrysts within pyroxene and as granular grains between oikocrysts. The remaining 10% of matrix has an ophitic texture with a fine intergrowth of euhedral plagioclase (0.2 to 0.35 mm) and subhedral pyroxene (0.2 to 0.8 mm). The contact between the two different matrix textures is said to be "distinct" (Simonds 1975). Some plagioclase clasts in the matrix have necklaces of mafic minerals and an overgrowth about 30 microns wide (figure 4).

Vugs in 76015 and 76215 contain euhedral crystals of troilite and metallic iron with crystal growth steps (Carter et al. 1975). Goldberg et al. (1975) reported thin coatings of F.

#### **Significant Clast**

#### *Granulitic Anorthosite: ,70*

McGee et al. (1977) describe a "large" anorthosite clast (2 mm) wuth polygonal grain boundaries and coarse texture in thin section 76215,70.

#### **Mineralogical Mode for 76215**

Simonds (1975) Olivine 7-14 % Low-Ca pyroxene 30 High-Ca Pyroxene 4-11 Plagioclase 50 Ilmenite 2

### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Olivine is Fo65-75

*Pyroxene:* Simonds (1975) found that the pryoxene composition in the two different matrix textures was zoned slightly different (figure 5).

*Plagioclase:* Plagioclase is An95-80

*Metallic iron:* Misra et al. (1976) determined the Ni and Co content of iron grains (figure 6).

#### **Chemistry**

Keith et al. (1974) determined the K, U and Th content of 76215 (complete sample). Simonds (1975) and Wiesmann and Hubbard (1975) found that the major and trace element composition of 76215 was identical to that of other samples of this boulder. Higuchi and Morgan (1975) determined trace volatile and siderophile elements. Puchtel et al. (2008) have

determined Re, Os, Ir, Ru, Pt, Pd and Os isotopes in 11 splits of 76215.

#### **Radiogenic age dating**

Cadogen and Turner (1976) dated 76215 along with other samples from the large boulder (figure 8). They obtained an age of 3.94 ± 0.04 b.y. by the Ar/Ar plateau technique.

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Keith et al. (1974) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 26Al =56 dpm/kg., 22Na = 60 dpm/kg., 54Mn = 22 dpm/kg., 56Co = 45 dpm/kg and 48V = 5 dpm/kg.

Cadogen and Turner (1976) determined an exposure age of 19 m.y. by the 38Ar method.

#### **Other Studies**

As in the case of 76015, 76215 has an apparently shielded interior surface of a large cavity (however, 76215 was recently broken from the boulder). The "lip" of this cavity has a thick, undisturbed patina which grades to thin (figure 9). Morrison and Zinner (1977) studied the crater size distribution and solar flare track density as function of depth in 76215.

Zinner et al. (1977) used 76215 to study Mg and Fe depth profiles in plagioclase due to solar flares, but this study is surely compromised by glass splashes on the exposed surface.

Gose et al. (1978) and Brecher (1976) have carefully studied the remanent magnetization of 26 subsamples from the Station 6 Boulder, finding that the direction of magnetization was generally aligned with direction of foliation.

Bogard (1974) determined the content and isotopic ratio of rare gases in 76215.

## **Processing**

A slab was cut through the middle of 76215 and columns were cut from the slab (figure 11). However, their orientation with respect to the surface of the Moon, and direction of cosmic rays, is unknown. In addition, it is not known how long the sample was exposed where it was found, on top of the regolith.

There are 22 thin sections of 76215.
