| LM         | P Hey, that's a different rock, Gene (station 2 boulder #2).   |     | size, and it's a square cross section. Well it's irregular;  |  |  |  |
| CD         | R Yes. Well, it looks like the same texture, but it's got that |     | but generally square cross section. It's in bag 516, and     |  |  |  |
|            | flaky fracture pattern all over it. I'm going to get a stereo  |     | looks like a high feldspar rock. It may be an anorthositic   |  |  |  |
|            | while I'm at it. This ought to cover any samples I take        |     | gabbro, but it does look like a prophyry.                    |  |  |  |
|            | off of that thing.                                             | CDR | There's a big chunk where I've got – I can't get it out      |  |  |  |
| LM         | P This is a crystalline rock, Houston. It's got nice white     |     | though; it's buried in a rock – half of an inch elongated    |  |  |  |
|            | halos around the pits. The zaps are not – dense black          |     | - I can't see whether they are colorless or not, but they    |  |  |  |
|            | glass, but very dark greenish-grey.                            |     | are certainly reflective crystals. And then in the big rock, |  |  |  |
| CD         | R Are those halos or fragments?                                |     | you've got massive things like this big fragment here-       |  |  |  |
| LM         | P No, they're halos. Well, they are fragments, I think, also.  |     | that's 5 inches across.                                      |  |  |  |
|            | It's fairly crystalline, but it is heterogeneous. Matter of    | LMP | That may be spall point, Gene, that's a lighter color, in    |  |  |  |
|            | fact there's a big fragment of a porphyry caught up in         |     | general, because of a zap or something.                      |  |  |  |
|            | this thing, I think. There's a chunk there we can get.         | CDR | Let me get some more samples of it.                          |  |  |  |
|            | That's a big fragment within this crystalline rock             | LMP | Yes, we need to get some of the host rock here.              |  |  |  |
|            | Inclusion (72315).                                             | CDR | We'll get a piece here.                                      |  |  |  |
| CD         | R Take a picture of that and then your locator, I'll get it.   | LMP | You're still sampling the one we just got. So we'll get      |  |  |  |
| LM         |                                                                |     | another one (72335). The same kind – or the contact of       |  |  |  |
| CD         | ,                                                              |     | that rock looks like it might be finer grained – but it's    |  |  |  |
| LM         | P Looks like an andesite prophyry.                             |     | about the same – in 517. That's the contact in the           |  |  |  |
| CD         | R The has got the very large crystals in there. They're        |     | inclusion side of the contact. Keep going after the other    |  |  |  |
|            | very reflective, elongated crystals.                           |     | one, Gene, I'll get this in your bag.                        |  |  |  |

LMP The host rock for the inclusion, which appears to be also crystalline, but may be a recrystallized rock of some kind - - metamorphic – also looks like a high plagioclase – high feldspar, anyway. That's in bag 518 – and that was a loose frag – fairly loose, but in place fragment along the fracture zone (72355).

CRD I'm going to try to get the rest of it up there.

LDR This is a medium-green anorthositic gabbro, and it looks like it has some pastel-green olivine crystals in it. Did you get it?

CDR I can't get any more of it, Jack, up there. I can't reach any more.

LMP OK, and that small chip of that is in bag 519 (72375). It's the same host rock, much like the previous samples. Another chunk of the host – It's in there. I haven't closed your bag yet. And we got to get one soil sample up the hill here.

CC Was that last sample in 518, as well?

LMP No. We haven't put it in yet.

CRD That will go in 499 (72395).

LMP This is a fairly uniform looking rock. It does have some widely spaced fractures across it. It's clearly crystalline and had crystalline inclusions in it. Both rocks look like they might be in the anorthositic class of rocks. It's just that it has the appearance of being finer grain matrix. Looks like a porphyry in the boulder.

#### Introduction

72335 was sampled, along with 72315, as a white clast in the large station #2 boulder (see transcript). However, most of it turned out to be similar to the matrix of the boulder (see section on 72395), and the astronauts were apparently simply seeing an area (spall?) that was free of dark patina (figure 2). This sample has not been dated, but can be assumed to have the same age as 72395 (3.9 b.y.).

## **Petrography**

Most of 72335 is similar to the other samples collected form this same boulder (72315, 72355, 72375 and 72395). They are all vesicular micropoikilitic impact melt breccias.

## Significant Clast

*Feldspathic Granulite:* Dymek et al. (1976) show a granulitic texture for a clast from 72335 (figure 3).

#### **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* The compositon of olivine grains is tightly grouped at  $Fo_{70\pm2}$ .

**Pink Spinel:** Pink spinel grains are Mg- and Al-rich in the center and zone to more Cr-rich at the edge.

**Pyroxene:** The composition of pyroxene is depicted in figure 5.

**Plagioclase:** Plagioclase ranges in composition from  $Or_{0.2}Ab_{2}An_{98}$  to about  $Or_{3}Ab_{22}An_{75}$  (Dymek et al. 1976).

*Ilmenite:* Ilmenite in 72335 is evenly dispersed in the matrix, has a seive-like texture and is Mg-rich.

*Metallic Iron:* Metallic iron is meteoritic in origin (see figure 7 in section on 72395).

*Armalcolite:* Armalcolite is found included in ilmenite and is Zr-rich.

#### Chemistry

The chemical composition of the matrix of 72335 is found to be identical to that of other samples of this

**Table 1. Chemical composition of 72335.** boulder (see 73215). However, Laul and Schmitt (1974) also determined the composition of a white clast (figure 6).

## **Radiogenic age dating**

The age of 72335 has not been measured, but is assumed to be ~ 3.9 b.y. (as measured for 72395). Tera et al. (1974) determined a Rb-Sr model age of 4.49 b.y.

## **Processing**

Boulder 2 was a "Wasserburg consortium". A saw cut, but not a slab, was made through the middle of 72335 (figure 7), so that part could be placed in "remote storage". There are 4 thin sections.
