### **Introduction**

These samples are the fines returned in bags with samples chipped off of the Station 7 boulder. 77070 was in the bag with 77075 – 77077, 77130 was in the bag with 77130 and 77210 is the remaining material in the bag with 77215 which was returned in about 40 pieces. They probably contain some soil from around the boulder, mixed with small pieces of the samples in their bags. They have not been studied.
