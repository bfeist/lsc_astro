### Introduction

Samples 78235-78238 were chipped off the top of a small glass-covered boulder (~ 0.5 meter) which was found "perched" on top of the lunar regolith at Station 8 (Jackson et al. 1975; Wolfe et al. 1981). The pieces fell in the soil from which they were collected 9figure 1). Sample 78237 was found to fit 78235, so they were numbered together as 78235 (199 grams)(figure 2). Samples 78236 and 78238 were chipped off adjacent areas and 78236 was used for many of the allocations. Samples 78255 and 78256 were chipped from the bottom of the boulder, after rolling it over. All of these samples were found to be similar (if not identical) to one another (Meyer 1994).

The Station 8 boulder (figure 1) was accurately described by the astronauts on the lunar surface: 06 20 20+ CDR "I think I'll get one more swap off there. Well, that disappeared. Get it this way. That disappeared, too? Boy, is that pretty inside. Whoo! We haven't seen anything like this. I haven't. Unless you've been holding out on me." LMP "No, this is a nice crystalline rock. This is about 50-50 mixture of what looks like maskelynite or at

least blue-grey plagioclase, and a very – let's say light yellow-tan mineral, probably orthopyroxene. It's fairly coarsely crystalline. By coarsely crystalline, probably, the average grain size will turn out to be about 3 or 4 millimeters, maybe half a centimeter".

Zap pits found on samples from top and bottom (see also 78255) of this "perched" boulder indicate that the boulder has rolled around on the lunar surface (Jackson et al. 1975). The fact that the boulder was covered with glass, indicated it may have been a "bomb". The age has been determined to be about 4.3 b.y. which has been used to constrain the end of the magma ocean, and beginning of mg-suite magmatism. It has been exposed to cosmic rays for about 300 m.y. The glass coating has not been dated.

### **Petrography**

Sample 78235 is a heavily-shocked norite of cumulate origin with a glass coating and glass veins (Jackson et al. 1975). Cumulus orthopyroxene is tabular, and generally ranges in size from 0.2 by 0.3 cm to 0.5 by 0.7 cm. Cumulus plagioclase ranges from 0.3 by 0.4

cm to 0.7 by 1.0 cm. Both minerals are partially shattered and much of the plagioclase is converted to maskelynite (figures 6 a,b). Small amounts of brightgreen postcumulus clinopyroxene can be seen in hand specimen. Jackson et al. give a description of the fabric and suggested history of the boulder. 78235 is considered an end member of the mg-norite suite (figure 9).

Trace amounts of metal, troilite, chromite, Nb-rutile, zircon and baddeleyite are also reported (Dymek et al. 1975; McCallum and Mathez 1975; Sclar and Bauer 1975, 1976; Steele 1975).

The shock event that disturbed 78235 has been investigated by Sclar and Bauer (1975, 1976). The presence of maskelynite indicates that the shock pressure was between 300 and 400 kbar, and the presence of glass veins may mean that the rock experienced pressures in excess of 500 kbar. Sclar and Bauer (1976) have speculated that fine oriented rods of metallic iron in the plagioclase and maskelynite are due to subsolidus reduction of iron during shock (but this feature was also observed in 76535).

# **Mineralogy**

**Pyroxene:** The composition of pyroxene in 78235 has been reported by McCallum and Mathez (1975), Dymek et al. (1975), Takeda et al. (1982) and Bersch et al. (1991). Homogeneous orthopyroxene  $Wo_3En_{78}Fs_{19}$  is dominant, with minor augite  $Wo_{47}En_{45}Fs_8$  (figure 7). McCallum and Mathez estimated a temperature of equilibration of ~800 deg C.

Steele (1975) found that the x-ray determined structure of orthopyoxene grains from the soil adjacent to 78235 had symmetry of space group P21 ca which requires long annealing time (Smyth 1974) suggesting plutonic conditions. It was noted by them that this is in contrast to the orthopyoxene commonly found in the "noritic" breccias from Apollo 17. Takeda et al. (1982) have also studied the structure of orthopyroxene in 78236. Winzer et al. (1975), Bersch et al. (1991), Hinthorne et al. (1977), Steele et al. (1980), Papike et al. (1994) and Palme et al. (1984) have reported the trace element content.

Trace amounts of augite are found intergrown with chromite, and other minor phases in the boundary areas.

*Plagioclase:* The composition of plagioclase (An93-95) in 78235 is given in figure 8. Much of it has been converted to maskelynite by shock. Winzer et al. (1975), Hansen et al. (1979) and Steele et al. (1980) and Papike et al. (1994) have determined the trace element content of plagioclase in 78235.

*Silica*: Steele (1975) and Dymek et al. reported silica.

*Chromite:* Dymek et al., McCallum and Mathez, Sclar and Bauer and Dymek et al. found chromite intergrown with augite and other accessory phases.

*Phosphate:* Both whitlockite and apatite are present (Steele 1975). McCallum and Mathez (1975) and Hinthorne et al. (1977) report analyses.

*Baddeleyite:* McCallum and Mathez (1975) give and analysis of baddeleyite. Hinthorne et al. (1977) were able to date it.

*Zircon:* Hinthorne et al. (1977) studied a large zircon.

the metal grains in the glass coating have low Co/Ni ratio indicating meteoritic contamination of the glass (figure 10).

*Troilite:* Steele (1975) reported large discrete grains of troilite.

*Glass*: The abundant, flow-banded, glass that surrounds and invades this sample has been carefully described by McCallum and Mathez (1975) and Dymek et al. (1975).

# **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of 78235 was determined by Winzer et al. (1975) and Higuchi and Morgan (1975) (table 1 and figure 11). Warren (1987) reported the chemical composition of a coarse-fine from the soil (78234) and Warren and Wasson (1979) have analyzed 78255. *Note: this is coarse-grained rock and the small sample size allocated for chemical analyses may necessarily lead to non-representative analyses.* 

The bulk composition of 78235 plots near the pyroxene-plagioclase coetectic on the phase diagram for lunar highland rocks at low pressure (Walker et al. 1973). The chemical composition of mineral seperates has been reported (figure 13).

The glass coatings and veins have also been analyzed (Winzer et al., Sclar and Bauer, Steele, McCallum and Mathez, and Dymek et al.). The composition of the glass coating and of the glass veins appear to be a mixture of the plagioclase and the pyroxene (figure 12).

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Hinthorne et al. (1977) dated 78235 by Pb-Pb ion probe method (see table). Although ages from three baddeleyites and one zircon in thin section 78235,49 were all consistent at 4.25 ± 0.09 b.y., these data required correction for unspecified molecular ion interferences. It is also difficult to understand how the U-Pb system in minor phases could not have been affected by the shock melting that is evident in this rock. For these reasons this Pb-Pb age is generally not accepted – although it has been generally confirmed by more recent work (see table).

Premo and Tatsumoto (1991 and 1992) have studied the U-Th-Pb isotopic systematics of 78235 and determined an initial crystallization age of 4.426 ± 0.065 b.y. with a disturbance at 3.93 ± 0.21 b.y. (figure 20). Sample 78236 (from the same rock) has also been dated by Nyquist et al. (1981), Carlson and Lugmair (1982), Aeschimann et al. (1982) and Edmumson et al. (2009)(see figure 14 - 21).

# **Other Studies**

Jackson et al. (1975) studied the fabric of this coarsegrain rock, Sclar and Bauer (1975, 1976) studied shock features and Simmons et al. (1975) remarked on the presence of "microcracks".

Mayeda et al. (1975) reported oxygen isotope analyses of plagioclase and of pyroxene from 78235 (they should have calculated a temperature).

# **Processing**

After the pieces were chipped off of the boulder, they fell in the regolith. During PET, 78237 and 78235 were found to fit together (figure 2) so 78237 was renumbered 78235,0. T8236 and 78238 are identical, as is 78255 (from the other side of boulder).

78235 is one of the rocks featured in the Lunar Petrographic Educational Thin Section Set (Meyer 2003).
