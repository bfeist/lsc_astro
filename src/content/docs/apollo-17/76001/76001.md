## **Introduction**

Lunar core 76001 (~34.5 cm) was collected from the bottom of the slope of the North Massif about 250 meters for the boundary with the mare surface and about 10 meters below the big boulder seen in all the pictures. It is a single drive tube (711.6 grams).

To date, drive tube 76001 has not been analyzed in as much detail as other lunar cores. It was found to be relatively uniform with depth, apparently due to continuous downslope migration of material from the North Massif (Korotev and Bishop 1993). The depositional history of this core is discussed by Nishiizumi et al. (1990) based on data for cosmogenic radionuclides.

## **Petrography**

Stu Nagle (1979) first described core sample 76001 and Papike and Wyszynski (1980) reported the optical mineral mode. While Nagle could distinguish as many as six stratigraphic units based on bulk observation, Papike and Wyszynski could only distinguish two petrographic units using thin sections; B (top) and A (bottom). Unit B extends from 0-20 cm, while unit A extends from 20-32 cm. Unit B is enriched in KREEPy noritic breccia and depleted in gabbroic anorthosite reative to unit A. Basalt fragments and fragments of the orange glass are present throughout the core, but only appear to be a minor component. This is surprising considering that the core was taken not far from a Mare surface and that the whole area is seen form orbit to have a "dark mantle".

Morris and Lauer (1979) found that the magnetic maturity index (Is/FeO) was uniformly mature with depth (figure 4).

#### **Chemistry**

Korotev and Bishop (1993) found that 76001 had a relatively homogeneous chemical composition (62 splits) (with the exception of a few metallic iron nuggets with high Ir, Au or Ni). Table 1 compares the average composition of 76001 with that of 76501 and other soils at station 6 (Rhodes et al. 1974; Korotev and Kremser 1992). Average for the top of the core (unit B) and for that of the bottom (unit A) show that they are basically the same mix of highland materials and mare materials (~3 to 1). Interestingly soil samples found near the big boulder have slightly elevated REE – probably derived from the boulder.

*One might speculate that the slight increase in trace element content of unit B compared to that of unit A was due to the arrival of the big boulder about 20 m.y. ago !* 

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

The activity of cosmic and solar ray (SCR)-produced radionuclides has been carefully determined for core 76001. These include 22Na, 26Al and 53Mn (figure 5) and 14C, 36Cl (figure 6). They generally show a predictable pattern for a core in steady state.

#### **Other Studies**

Crozaz (1980) found a high count of cosmic ray induced tracks throughout the core (figure 7).

#### **Processing**

Lunar core 76001 is a single drive tube collected from the soil at the bottom of the North Massif about 250 meters from the mare boundary. It was simply pushed in, up to about 16 cm, and then hammered (5-6 blows) to 37.1 cm (34.5 cm were recovered). 76001 was capped on both ends and brought to Earth in a bag where it was not well protected from spacecraft nor Pacific Ocean atmospheres.

In the LRL, it was X-rayed and material taken from the top 4 mm in order to have splits from the lunar surface (figure 8). It was then extruded and dissected in 1978 (Curatorial Newsletter#23). Finally, the remainder (~1/3) was encapsulated in epoxy, split lengthwise (twice), with one side cut into potted butts (PB) for three sets of continuous thin sections (as indicated). Figure 1 is a collage of photos of a sawn surface cut lengthwise thru the epoxy encapsulated core (called a "reference" piece).

Korotev and Bishop (1993) reported two kinds of contamination; high Au in the topmost samples and several "nuggets" of metallic iron (with terrestrial-like composition) in the upper part.
