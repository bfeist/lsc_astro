## **Introduction**

These friable breccia samples have a lightly brownish color as though they were pieces of a soil clod. They were probably pieces of the second sample collected at station E and contained in the same bag as 14055 - 14058. They have not been studied. They were returned, under vacuum, in ALSEP 1006.

Swann et al. (1977) described 14056 – 14061 as "blocky, subrounded rocks mostly lacking zap pits and fractures. The samples are very friable, fine-grained

clastic rocks with less than 5 percent subrounded lightcolored clasts in a medium gray to brownish gray matrix." Jack Schmitt dubs these soil breccias as "instant rocks".

## **Petrography**

There are no thin sections of these particles.

## **Chemistry**
