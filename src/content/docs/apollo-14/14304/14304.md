# **Introduction**

14304 was collected as a "football-sized" rock specifically to allow study of solar-galactic cosmic ray interaction with the lunar surface, but it was apparently never used for that purpose because of poor documentation. 14304 was returned in same bag as 14303, 14302-14305 and numerous smaller fragments. It has been found to be a part of 14303 (figure 1). Probably some of the small fragments in the same bag were also part of the 14303-14304 pair (see section on 14303). Samples 14304-14303 and 14305-14302 were picked up during the first EVA and documented by photos AS14-67-9390 and AS14-67-9392. They were from an area between the LM and the ALSEP site (Swann et al. 1977).

About 1986, Klaus Keil initiated a consortium study of 14304 (originally considered a Posterity Sample). His group was the first to extract clasts to study their chemical and mineralogical composition (Goodrich et al. 1986).

# **Petrography**

McGee et al. (1979) describe 14304 as a clast-rich impact-melt breccia characterized by a wide range of mineral and lithic clast types in a recrystallized matrix. The matrix consists of irregularly shaped patches of lighter and darker areas, caused by fewer and larger ilmenite crystals in the coarser-grained lighter areas as compared with more abundant and smaller ilmenite grains in the fire-grained darker matrix patches. The matrix contains both small voids between grains and

larger vugs up to 0.75 mm across. No glass clasts are present (Chao et al. 1971).

The mineral clast population is dominated by subangular to subrounded clasts of plagioclase (up to 0.7 mm) with common undulatory extinction. Pyroxene and olivine clasts (up to 0.3 mm) are highly

fractured and sometimes contain opaque phases. Fragments of irregularly shaped ilmenite, amoeboid-shaped troilite and micron-sized blebs of Fe-Ni are scattered randomly throughout the matrix.

Goodrich et al. (1986), Warren et al. (1987), Neal et al. (1989) and Snyder et al. (1995) have studied numerous lithic clasts extracted from the matrix of 14304.

#### **Significant Clasts**

#### Troctolite clast "a" ~ 1 cm.

Goodrich et al. (1986) described clast "a" (,96 and ,126) as  $\sim 40\text{-}50\%$  coarse-grained olivine and plagioclase (1 mm) with a cumulate texture (minerals only slightly shocked). The olivine (Fo<sub>87</sub>) has low CaO typical of plutonic fragments. Plagioclase is An<sub>93.5</sub> (figure 6). The REE content is high with a "bow-shaped" pattern (figure 8). It was found to be pristine (Warren 1993).

#### Spinel Troctolite clast "q" TS,109 TS,251

Thin section ,109 has a clast of spinel troctolite with plagioclase  $(An_{94})$ , olivine  $(Fo_{91})$  and spinel (11%  $Cr_2O_3$ ). Warren (1993) lists it as pristine. Shervais and McGee (1998) give ion probe analyses of minerals in this clast.

# Alkali Anorthosite clast "b" ,122 ,100 ,212 ,214 ,267

This white clast is estimated 7-9 mm in diameter (Goodrich et al. 1986), Warren et al. 1987, Snyder et al. 1995). It has been dated by Rb-Sr and Sm – Nd (figure 14). It is mostly (~95%) plagioclase (An<sub>81</sub>, but Snyder et al. reported a wider range).

#### **Dunite clast "d" ,121 ,92**

Goodrich et al. (1986) and Warren et al. (1987) studied an almost pure olivine clast (2 – 6 mm). It had a texture with smaller olivine crystals (Fo89) imbedded in large ones, with occasional "mosaic" texture.

# **Alkali Norite clast "g" TS,30 ,86 ,87 ,270 ,272, TS,209, TS,210**

This clast (4 x 7 mm) was first seen in thin section (,30, 75% pyroxene En63-66, 14% plagioclase An82, 2% phosphate). Veins in this clast have K-feldspar, ternary feldspar, whitlockite and apatite (Goodrich et al. 1986). Warren (1993) found that it was "pristine", and Snyder et al. (1995) provided isotopic data.

#### **VHK Basalt Clasts**

Neal et al. (1989a and b) studied 6 clasts of VHK basalt (which are called that because they have very high potassium content) extracted from 14304. However, their wide range in trace element content makes it look like the portions analyzed may have had some remaining matrix attached (figure 7). They are not listed as pristine in the compilation by Warren (1993).

# **Basalt clasts "c" TS,91, ,113 ,127 and "i" TS,58 ,108 ,128**

Goodrich et al. (1986) analyzed two basalt clasts from 14304 and gave mineral analyses. Shih et al. (1987) were able to date two of them (figures 10 -13). They

had Rb contents intermediate between mare basalts and VHK basalts. Their "pristinity" has not been proven.

# **Chemistry**

The bulk chemical composition of 14304 was found to be similar to that of other Apollo 14 breccias (Christian et al. 1976). The trace element composition of the matrix of 14304 has not been determined, but the analysis of 14303 by Brunfelt et al. (1972) will have to suffice. The sawdust from 14305 is similar and is likely to be even more representative, because the analyses of very small portions of the matrix of these breccias may not be as representative as the sawdust (Philpotts et al. 1972).

The composition of small clasts dug out of the matrix is problematical, because it is inherently difficult to avoid contamination by the trace-element-rich matrix. However, the analyses exist (tables, figures 7 - 9) and the wide range in trace element content has even been attributed to assimilation of country rock by the magma

during assent to the surface (Snyder et al. 1995). However, Goodrich et al. (1986) showed that clasts in 14304 have reacted with the breccia matrix!

# **Radiogenic age dating**

Shih et al. (1987) dated two clasts of VHK basalt from 14304 (figures 10 - 13). Snyder et al. (1995) dated alkali anorthosite clast 14304,267 by Sm-Nd at 4.108 Ga (figure 14). Snyder et al. (1995) have provided further isotopic data on some of the clasts.

# **Processing**

Originally collected as one of the "football-sized rocks" for solar and cosmic ray studies, 14304 broke up in the sample bag (#1027). In 1977, the models for 14303 and 14304 were found to fit together – see figure 1.

Originally a "posterity" sample, 14304 wasn't studied until 1986 when a thick slab was cut lengthwise through the main mass at the request of Klaus Keil. It has since been "pulled" apart by Larry Taylor in an effort to get at the clasts. There is no guidebook.
