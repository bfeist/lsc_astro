# **Introduction**

Based on a stated desire of scientists interested in studies of the interaction of cosmic ray radiation with the lunar surface, the Apollo 14 astronauts collected several "football-sized" rocks, the largest of which was 14321 (which came to be known as Big Bertha). It was collected from near the edge of Cone Crater and is generally interpreted as a piece of the Fra Mauro Formation (Wilshire and Jackson 1972, Swann et al. 1972, 1977).

The "life and times" of Big Bertha were initially discussed in detail in a series of papers by Grieve et al. (1975), Duncan et al. (1975a, 1975b) and Morgan et al. (1975). These studies showed that 14321 was a clastic rock with a variety of lithic and microbreccia clasts (figures 1 - 5). The classification of fragmental

breccias from the Fra Mauro Formation was reviewed by Simonds et al. (1977), who found that it was a crystalline matrix breccia (CMB) with about 30% clasts. Warner (1972) placed it in group 4, Chao (1972) group 2b, Wilshire and Jackson (1972) group F4 of their schemes of classification. Wilshire and Jackson suggest that F4 breccias were from the bottom part of the Fra Mauro Formation.

Kohl et al. (1978) showed that the depth profiles in 14321 for 53Mn and 26Al could be explained using the same parameters for cosmic rays as used for 14310 and 68815.

Two breccia guidebooks were prepared (Meyer and King 1979, Shervais et al. 1984), and these led to many studies of the breccia clasts. Shervais et al., in particular, gave an excellent review of what had been learned about this important breccia up to that point.

*note: 14321 has so many studies that they simply can't all be included in this compilation. Sorry!*

The age of the Fra Mauro Formation and Imbrium Event is about 3.85 ± 0.02 b.y. (see review by Stöffler and Ryder 2001). The clasts in Apollo 14 breccias must necessarily be older than the event that created the breccias, and indeed such was found to be the case (see below). Conversely, the age of Imbrium must be younger than the youngest clast found included in the breccias, if these breccias were indeed formed by this event (Stadermann et al. 1991)!

The trace siderophile composition of the various lithologies of 14321 indicate that the last lithification event did not contribute significant additional meteoritic material.

# **Petrography**

The breccia matrix was studied by SEM petrography by Lally et al. (1972) and Phinney et al. (1977). The matrix is mostly crystalline with grain size 1-5 microns and microvoid space 15-20% (figure 5). Phinney et al. describe the matrix as crystalline, moderately coherent and the result of sintering in hot ejecta blanket

without digestion of clasts. On the other hand, Lally et al. attribute the recrystallization of the matrix as due to "shock sintering". It should be noted that the rock proved to be quite "crumbly" during processing (figure 1).

Wilshire and Jackson (1972) and Grieve et al. (1975) found that 14321 was clast-rich with lithic clasts greater than 1 mm making up more than 30% of the rock. They noted that, in general, the clasts had not reacted with, nor been significantly resorbed by, the matrix. Some clasts are quite large and have received much attention (see below), but most are themselves microbreccias of the approximate same composition as the whole (albeit a darker color). The majority of the non-breccia clasts are aluminous basalts (some quite large). Some are referred to as olivine vitrophyre (Allen et al. 1979). Only a small number of possibly-pristine "plutonic" rock fragments were found (figure 4) and none of these were found to be "norite" nor "ferroan anorthosite" (*sensostricto*).

Lindstrom et al. (1972) and Duncan et al. (1975) found that the dark, microbreccia clasts contained more rareearth-elements (La = 78 – 112 ppm) than the light matrix material (La = 27 – 51 ppm). The dark microbreccia also was found to contain small clasts of

"micro norite" (Grieve et al. 1975), although no large clasts of this material were found.

# **Significant Clasts**

Breccia 14321 has proven to be a treasure chest of important rock clasts from the crust of the moon, but the information for various clasts extracted from 14321 is spread out in the literature. Some clasts were large enough for analysis by several techniques (see table 4

for cross-correlation). Many small clasts are seen in thin section (figure 5).

Taylor et al. (1972) and Ware and Green (1977) reported on a troctolite clast as well as two basalt clasts. Wänke et al. (1972) determined the matrix composition as well as two igneous clasts. Allen et al. (1979) and Shervais et al. (1988) reported on olivine vitrophyre clasts in 14321. Shervais et al. (1983, 1985) analyzed 11 clasts and studied thin sections of them. Lindstrom et al. (1984) studied 7 additional clasts, including magnesian anorthosite, troctolite and "dunite". Dickinson et al. (1985) studied basalts from the processing fines. But Paul Warren made the most fuss, so we shall start with his observations:

### c1 (W-101) from ,46 and ,116

Warren et al. (1981) reported that this large (18 x 12 mm) anorthositic troctolite was about 60% plagioclase  $(An_{96})$  and 40% olivine  $(Fo_{88})$ , with trace orthopyroxene and diopside (figure 4). Apparently a second piece of this same clast was also studied by Lindstrom et al.

(1984) and Shervais and McGee (1998). Warren et al. found it to be pristine (Ir = 0.053 ppb).

### c2 (W-1) from ,37

Warren et al. (1981) studied this clast of anorthositic troctolite. It is mostly plagioclase  $(An_{95})$  with some olivine  $(Fo_{87})$  and trace ilmenite and chromite! Ir = 0.031.

# c3 ,1035

Warren et al. (1983a) analyzed this small clast and found it was a Mg-rich anorthositic troctolite with about 70% plagioclase (An95), 30% olivine (Fo85) and trace pyroxene and opaque. Ir = 0.58.

## c4 ,1027

Warren et al. (1983a, b) analyzed a granite clast (1.8 g?) in 14321 (table 3). The mineralogical mode of this clast (14321,1027) was reported to be ~60% K-feldspar and 40% quartz with minor Fe-rich pyroxene, ilmenite and yttrobetafite (Meyer and Yang 1988) and zircon (Meyer et al. 1996). The graphic texture is that of intergrown K-spar and silica. Nyquist et al. (1983) and Shih et al. (1985, 1993) dated this clast as 4.09 ± 0.11 by Rb-Sr, 4.11 ± 0.2 by Sm-Nd (figure 27), and 4.06 ± 0.07 by K-Ca (figure 26), while Meyer et al. (1996) dated the U-rich zircon in this granite clast at 3.965 b.y. by U-Pb. Warren et al. found it to be pristine (Ir = 0.047 ppb).

## c5 ,1060

Warren et al. (1983b) analyzed a plagioclase-rich clast (6 x 3.5 mm) they termed alkali anorthosite (table 3) that was extracted from 14321,117. This small clast was ~96% plagioclase (An77-89), 1-2% whitlockite, 1 2% pyroxene (scatter) and1% ilmenite, with an annealed cataclastic texture. Warren et al. also give mineral compositions (figure 11). Ir = ?

## 8A from ,88 (0.5g)

The troctolite clast dated by Compston et al. (1972) at 3.74 ± 0.17 b.y. was analyzed and described by Ware

and Green (1977). It has 35% olivine (Fo<sub>86</sub>), set in  $\sim$ 60% plagioclase (An<sub>95</sub>) with minor whitlockite, ilmenite, chrome spinel and trace armalcolite and K-Ba feldspar. The olivine and plagioclase are unzoned (figure 10). It was also analyzed by Taylor et al. (1972) (table 3).

Sample 14321 contains (as clasts) a rich variety of low-Ti, aluminous mare basalts (Chao et al. 1972, Taylor et al. 1972, Wänke et al. 1972, Duncan et al. 1975a,b, Grieve et al. 1975, Ware and Green 1977, Takeda et al. 1980, Shervais et al. 1984, Dickinson et al. 1985, Neal et al. 1988, 1989). Although these basalt clasts have relatively uniform major-element compositions, they are reported to have an eight-fold variation in "incompatible trace elements" (Dickinson et al. 1985, Neal et al. 1989). The REE patterns vary from KREEP-like (group 1) to low and flat (group 5). Basalt clast groups 2-4 are intermediate, but all lack the bow-shaped pattern characteristic of mare basalts (Shervais et al. 1985). Group 3 basalts are roughly similar to sample 14053 (which may itself have been a clast in the Fra Mauro Formation). Neal et al. (1989b) provide a model for the origin of these aluminous basalts. Dickinson et al. (1985) analyzed 36 fragments of basalt from the processing fines (Meyer and King 1979) and found that they were all high alumina (HA). Neal et al. (1989) provided data for 26 additional fragments of HA basalt

from 14321. One of the largest basalt clasts in 14321 was B-102 (figure 4), but it is not clear whether it has been analyzed or dated (although it was probably sampled in one of the processing fines studied by Dickinson et al.)

Another group of basalts in 14321 were termed Olivine Vitrophyre Basalts (Allen et al. 1979). These were first seen in thin section only, but later recognized and analyzed by Shervais et al. (1988). The average olivine vitrophyre (AOV) composition is given in table 3A. Note that AOV is ~6 ppb Ir!

## 6A from ,88 (0.15g)

Basalt clast, similar to 14053, with  $\sim$ 20% olivine and equal quantities of plagioclase and pyroxene with fine grained ilmenite (Ware and Green 1977). Compston et al. (1972) dated this basalt at  $4.05 \pm 0.08$  b.y.

## 4A from ,88 (0.15g)

Basalt clast with  $\sim$ 3% olivine, 5% opaques and more pyroxene than plagioclase (Ware and Green 1977). Compston et al. (1972) dated this clast – (revised downward to  $4.08 \pm 0.1$  b.y. see de Laeter et al. 1973)

#### X1

Basalt clast X1 (Gancarz et al. 1971) is a subophitic to intergranular basalt composed of  $\sim$ 70% plagioclase and clinopyroxene ( $\sim$ 25%) that was dated by Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1971). It contained high Ni metal grains (Gancarz et al. 1971).

#### B1

Basalt clast found by Morgan et al. (1975) and Warren et al. (1979) to have low meteoritic siderophile content – thus pristine.

## B-101 from ,46

This large basalt clast (figures 4 and 7) may not have been analyzed or dated yet!

Numerous clasts of troctolite, anorthosite, etc. are described in Lindstrom et al. (1984), Snyder et al. (1995), and Shervais and McGee (1998). Troctolite clast ,1379 was described by Snyder et al. as  $\sim$ 72% plagioclase (An<sub>94-96</sub>), 27% olivine (Fo<sub>86-88</sub>) with minor diopside (Wo<sub>45-47</sub>En<sub>49-51</sub>). See table 4 as a guide to these clasts. Note that norite, and or ferroan anorthosite clasts are absent from this clast collection (except perhaps

as minute fragments in the dark microbreccias (see Grieve et al. 1975).

Many more clasts are seen in thin section only (Wilshire and Jackson 1971, Chao et al. 1972). Gay et al. (1972) and Meyer et al. (1988) describe an anorthosite clast with ilmenite and zircon found in thin section 14321,16 and ,17. Steele (1972) and Steele and Smith (1975) describe a unique pink-spinel bearing clast in thin section 14321,76. Wilshire and Jackson pictured a melted and recrystallized granophyre clast.

# **Mineralogy**

*Olivine:* Olivine compositions range widely (figures 6, 8 and 11). Steele and Smith (1975) and Grieve et al. (1975) determined the trace element contents of olivines.

*Pyroxene:* Pyroxene compositions of "mineral clasts" in the matrix are given in diagram form in Stöffler and Knöll (1977) and Simonds et al. (1977). Takeda et al. (1980) carefully studied chemical zoning in one of the high-Al basalts. Grieve et al. (1975) report exsolved

pyroxene as well as orthopyroxene. There is a higher proportion of orthopyroxene in the microbreccia lithologies than in the matrix.

*Plagioclase:* Grieve et al. found plagioclase ranged from An72 to An96. Shervais and McGee (1998) studied

the REE patterns of plagioclase in troctolite and anorthosite clasts in 14321.

*Phosphates:* Grieve et al. reported apatite and whitlockite analyses. Ware and Green (1977) give an analysis of whitlockite in the troctolite clast 8A.

*Opaques:* Ilmenite is the most important opaque (Grieve et al.), but Ti-Cr spinels are also present. Steele (1972) analyzed the Cr-spinel. Sphene is also reported by Grieve et al.

*Zircon:* Braddy et al. (1975) determined the U content of 93 zircons extracted from 14321 (U = 15 – 400 ppm) . Meyer et al. (1996) and Nemchin et al. (2006, 2008) dated large zircons extracted from 14321 sawdust by ion microprobe (U = 8 – 900 ppm). Also see analysis of zircon in Grieve et al. (1975).

*Yttrobetafite:* Meyer and Yang (1988) found that this metamict mineral contained significant Nb and W.

## **Chemistry**

Eldridge et al. (1972) determined bulk K, Th and U contents of large pieces by "radiation counting" (table 1) and these analyses probably give the best idea of the "whole rock" composition (compare with Palme et al. 1978). Scoon (1972) and Strasheim et al. (1972) give bulk analyses of the "whole rock". Wänke et al. (1972), Boynton et al. (1975) and Palme et al. (1978) appears to have analyzed the matrix, while others may have analyzed only very small, unrepresentative portions of this massive breccia (table 1). Lindstrom et al. (1972), Duncan et al. (1975) and Morgan et al. (1975) showed that there were more rare-earthelements and more meteoritic contamination (Ir, Au etc.) in the dark microbreccia clasts than in the light matrix of 14321. The parental rock type that provides the high REE content of the microbreccia, remains a mystery.

Table 2 tabulates only a few of the basalt analyses. They were all found to have uniformly high Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Duncan et al. (1975) analyzed 15 basalts, but did not match them with thin sections. Dickinson et al. (1985) analyzed 36 fragments of basalt, and found five (5) different groups. However, since their fragments were from the processing fines, presumably at least some were from the same broken basalt clast, yielding artificial groupings. Shervais et al. (1985) analyzed 13 more and Neal et al. (1988) an additional 26. When all the data are plotted, there appears to be a continuum of these basalts (figure 11). Figure 12 shows the REE patterns for some of the basalts.

Shervais et al. (1988) report the average composition of olivine vitrophyre clasts (AOV) – see table 3A.

However, note that there is about 6 ppb Ir (non-pristine?)

Analyses of possibly-pristine, plutonic, rock clasts are given in table 3.

## Radiogenic age dating

The age of the breccia matrix has not been well determined. Both Turner et al. (1971) and York et al. (1972) determined stair-step Ar release patterns for the matrix – yielding total K-Ar ages of 3.93 and 4.06 b.y. (but this can't be right!). Clearly the matrix sample includes minerals of various old ages, which have not all been degassed of old Ar (figure 19).

Mark et al. (1973, 1974, 1975) dated several basalt and microbreccia clasts in 14321 by Rb-Sr (figures 21, 22). Compston et al. (1972), Papanastassiou and Wasserburg (1971), York et al. (1972) and Dash et al. (1987) have also dated the basalt fragments in 14321 (figures 20, 23, 24 and 25).

Compston et al. (1972) dated a "troctolite clast" (see table).

Meyer et al. (1996) dated zircons, including one in the granite clast analysed by Warren et al. (1983) and dated by Nyquist et al. (1983) and Shih et al. (1985) (figure 27). Nemchin et al. (2006, 2008) dated additional zircons from 14321, finding a wide range of ages.

Mark et al. (1975) first noted that the initial Sr ratios for basalt isochrons were distinctly different, such that they must be from different basalt flows and were not equilibrated when incorporated into the crystalline

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Eldridge et al. (1972), Rancitelli et al. (1972) and Kieth et al. (1972) reported 22Na, 26Al, 54Mn, 56Co and 48Sc activity for large pieces of 14321. Wahlen et al. (1972) reported 56Co, 54Mn, 55Fe, 22Na, 26Al, 53Mn, 36Cl and 10Be activity in smaller samples, including surface samples with high activity of 56Co (77 day half life). 14321 was used for 53Mn and 26Al depth profiles (Wahlen et al. 1972, Imamura et al. 1974, Kohl et al. 1978) (see figure 30).

Burnett et al. (1972) reported an 38Ar exposure age of 24 ± 2 m.y. Lugmair and Marti (1972) determined an exposure age for 14321 of 23.8 m.y. by the 81Kr method. This is interpreted to be the age of cone crater (Burnett et al., Arvidson et al. 1975). Burnett et al. also found that 14321 must have been buried about 4 meters during part of its history.

# **Other Studies**

Morrison et al. (1972) counted the micrometeorite craters on various surfaces of 14321. Remanent magnetization was studied by Gose et al. (1972), Pearce et al. (1972) and Hargraves and Dorety (1972). Pearce et al. found that the thermoremanent magnetization was

![](_page_17_Figure_0.jpeg)

directionally consistent in three different fragments of 14321.

Crozaz et al. (1972) and Hutcheon et al. (1972) etched fossil fission tracks in phosphates in 14321 in an attempt to search for evidence of extinct 244Pu.

Nemchin et al. (2006) determined the oxygen isotope composition of zircons.

# **Processing**

14321 was oriented by photography to establish its top lunar surface (Swann 1971). Warner and Heiken (1972) made a map of the surface of 14321 before it was subdivided. It was originally cut in half, and a thick column (,45) was prepared from one half (figure 27) for initial allocations. A large piece (,40) is on public display at the Smithsonian and another large piece (,38) is in remote storage. In 1982, the largest remaining piece (,37) was slabbed parallel to its west face (the original saw cut, figure 2), creating pieces ,1082 ,1083 and ,1084 (Shervais et al. 1984)(see flow diagram). In 1986, the remains of ,37 were again sawn to reveal interior clasts.

Gordon Goles led the first consortium study of 14321 (preliminary results reported in Lindstrom et al. 1972, Duncan et al. 1975). Located in their 70 gram piece (,184) were three basalts (one of which was estimated at 20 grams). Unfortunately, in this initial study "it was not possible to match specific clasts between thin sections and the fragment surfaces which were to be sampled because of the way in which the thin sections were prepared."

A consortium of Bill Compston, John Lovering, Ted Ringwood and Ross Taylor studied sample 14321,88 (84 grams), which also had three basaltic pebbles (clasts) (Ware and Green 1977).

Two breccia guidebooks were prepared to guide in the selection of clasts for further study: Meyer and King (1979) and Shervais, Knapp and Taylor (1984). The data packs describing the allocations of 14321 occupy a full shelf in the data center at JSC.

The large piece (,88) that was initially studied by Compston et al., has been returned, and is now available for experiments in the PI Experiment laboratory at JSC.

There are more than 100 thin sections of 14321!

Grieve et al. (1975) state *"Analysis and interpretation of a complex rock like 14321 is rewarded with few categorical conclusions, but we believe that the elucidation of its compositional character and assembly history leads to a very probably evolutionary picture for this area of the Moon".* They suggest a partial schematic history in their paper*.*
