#### Introduction

At the end of the first EVA on Apollo 14, a large soil sample was collected from the area near the LM. The area, about 15 meters from the LM, was apparently free of rock fragments (see Graf 1993), and not many were sieved from the large soil collected. The transcript indicates that the bulk soil sample was scooped from a small (2 foot) crater with glass in the bottom, possibly secondary in origin. 14163 should be compared with 14259, which is more of a surface sample.

Twenty nine small rock samples from this soil were numbered 14425 to 14453. Reserve soil 14421 (<1 cm) and 14422 and 14423 were also from this bag. *Note: It seems odd, that out of all this soil, only a few rock chips were collected.* 

# **Petrography**

14163 was chosen as one of the reference soils for the lunar highlands suite (Labotka et al. 1980).

The maturity index for 14163 (I<sub>s</sub>/FeO = 57, submature) was reported by Morris (1978) and the soil contained about 46 % agglutinates. King et al. (1972), McKay et al. (1972) and others determined the grain size distribution (figure 1).

Carr and Meyer (1972) and Simon et al. (1981) determined the petrographic mode, finding a very high percentage of glass (figure 4). Much of this is agglutinate glass but Papike et al. (1982) note that some of the glass has the composition of mare basalt (an exotic component at the A14 site). There is also a small percentage of "granitic" glass.

A glass sphere (14425) was found in the particles from 14163 and was allocated to John O'Keefe. Kramer and Twedell (1977) sorted and described a portion of the coarse fine particles (14160) and also found a high percentage of agglutinates (Table 3). McKay et al. (1979) studied three breccias from 14160, while Hubbard et al. (1972), Taylor et al. (1972) and Powell and Weiblen (1972) reported on other fragments from this large soil sample. Brad Jolliff (1991) studied three crystalline coarse-fines of granitic composition from 14161 (Table 4).

Finkelman (1973) and Devine et al. (1982) studied the finest fraction, concluding that compositional differences are related to comminution of local components. Walker and Papike (1981) determined the composition and considered the origin of agglutinates in 14163, which fuse

Papike et al. (1982) summarized the mineral compositions in 14163 (figure 3). They found that the

minerals in the soil were mostly derived from the Fra Mauro breccias and/or KREEP basalt.

# **Chemistry**

Taylor et al. (1972), Laul et al. (1972), Lindstrom et al. (1972), Rose et al. (1972), Hubbard (1972), Wanke et al. (1972), Masuda et al. (1972), Laul and Papike (1980), Morgan et al. (1972), Baedecker et al. (1972), Willis et al. (1972), Brunfelt et al. (1972), Helmke et al. (1972), Philpotts et al. (1972), Quaide and Wrigley (1972) and Keith et al. (1972) all analyzed 14163 (table 1, figures 5 and 6).

Laul and Papike (1980) and Papike et al. (1982) calculate the relative proportion of rock types present in 14163 using a chemical mixing model (55-67% high-K KREEP, 6-15% exotic mare basalt and the rest low-K Fra Mauro basalt).

*Figure 3: Labotka et al. (1980) and Papike et al. (1982) summarized the mineral compositions in 14163.* 

Moore et al. (1972) and Cadogen et al. (1972) reported 120 ppm carbon (figure 7). Goel and Kothari (1972) determined nitrogen = 80 ppm.

**Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages** 

Keith et al. (1972) determined the cosmic-ray-induced activity of 22Na = 46 dpm/kg., 26Al = 79 dpm/kg, 46Sc = 0.7 dpm/kg., 54Mn = 4 dpm/kg and 56Co = 21 dpm/kg. for 14163. Begemann et al. (1972) obtained 26Al = 86 dpm/kg. and 36Cl = 25 dpm/kg. Quaide and Wrigley (1972) determined 22Na = 71 dpm/kg and 26Al = 88 dpm/kg.

Particles from 14161 and 14160 have long exposure ages (Kirsten et al. 1972; Lugmair and Marti 1972).

*CC Rodger. If you take an additional weigh bag, and put material from the immediate vicinity of the LM into it to fill up the SRC, we request that you drop a documented sample bag in it as a tag (1 N).* 

*CDR Okay, I guess we've got a little room to do that. I put the foot-ball-sized rocks in the STB.* 

*- - - - -*

*LMP Why don't you let me help you with the – let's take the shovel, Al; it'll be faster.*

*CDR All right.*

*LMP Trenching tool.*

*CDR Want to hold the bag?*

*LPM Yes.*

*CDR Let's hit the little crater out there. It looks like a secondary.*

*LMP Let's go get it.*

*CDR Right out here.*

*LMP I saw a little crater about this size out here that I'd swear had glass in the bottom of it, but I was too busy thumping to stop and make any comment on it.*

*CDR There's a little different colored layer at the bottom of it there.*

*LMP Yes. Scoop it out. \*\*\**

*CDR See, there's a different color there, maybe. Okay how does that look to you?*

*LMP I can take another shovelful.*

*CDR Okay. Houston, that's in a small crater, looks like it might be a secondary impact, just hazarding a guess; it's about 2 feet in diameter, and it's about 130 feet from the LM.*

# **Other Studies**

A very large number of highly imaginative studies have been performed on this soil; only a few are mentioned here. See also sections on 14259, 14149, 14003 etc. Gibson and Moore (1972) determined the gas release profile (figure 9).

Cadenhead et al. (1972) studied the adsorption of water (figure 8).

Heymann et al. (1972), Bogard and Nyquist (1972) and Baur et al. (1972) reported rare gas data.. Tatsumoto et al. (1972) studied the U, Th and Pb

systematics.

Crozaz et al. (1972), Bhandari et al. (1972) and Berdot et al. (1972) reported the density of nuclear and cosmicray tracks (less than for 14259).

# **Processing**

The bulk soil was placed in weight bag #2 (number 1028), which was returned in D-ALSRC#1007 (it was processed in  $N_2$  atmosphere). The processing of sample 14163/14422 was not well documented (figure 1b). A portion of 14422 (285 g) was used as the "biopool sample" for the purpose of quarantine. Other portions were set aside as "organic reserves".
