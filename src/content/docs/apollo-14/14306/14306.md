# **Introduction**

breccia from Station G, Apollo 14 (about 3 crater been oriented (Swann et al. 1970). It was partially diameters of Cone Crater). The crystalline matrix buried. It is somewhat rounded and has micrometeoite breccias from Apollo 14 are thought to be from the Fra crarters on most surfaces. There is a prominent vein Mauro Formation, which was recognized as ejecta from of black glass, probably produced by the last impact. the giant Imbrium Basin (Gilbert 1895). The saw cuts revealed a nice clastic texture (figure 1).

Lunar sample 14306 is a clast-rich, crystalline matrix 14306 was photographed on the lunar surface and has

Anderson et al. (1972) describe 14306 as a "multi generation breccia". Interior clasts are also clastic in nature, indicating that there may have been earlier breccia-forming events.

The cosmic-ray exposure age is 25 m.y., which is thought to be the age of Cone Crater. There are more micrometeorite craters per unit area on 14306 than just about any other lunar sample (Neukum et al.1973).

Norite clasts in 14306 were dated by ion microprobe to be 4.2 b.y. old.

# **Petrography**

Simonds et al. (1977) noted that 14306 has little matrix, but that it was made of plentiful clasts (>50%) of crystalline matrix breccia.

Wosinski et al. (1972) studied the glass vein that penetrates 14306.

## **Significant Clasts**

## Ferroan Anorthosite ,71 ,72

Shervais et al. (1983) reported mineral modes and compositions for this small anorthosite clast found only in thin section (figure 5). It is 90% plagioclase ( $An_{98}$ ), with pyroxene ( $En_{67}$ ) and minor olivine ( $Fo_{70}$ ) and augite.

#### Norite Clast ,63 ,65

Meyer et al. (1989) and Nemchin et al. (2008) reported a norite clast with zircons in 14306. The norite is fractured and broken but all the minerals within the clast have chemical compositions that are consistent with one rock (monomic breccia).

## **Mineralogy**

Meyer et al. (1989) and Nemchin et al. (2008) studied several zircons in the norite clasts in 14306. This is one of the few cases where zircons are still attached to their mineral assemblage.

#### **Chemistry**

Taylor et al. (1972), Wiik et al. (1973) determined the composition (figures 6 and 8). Ganapathy et al. (1974) discuss the trace element composition of 14306.

# **Radiogenic age dating**

The breccia event represented by 14306 has not been dated (probably 3.9 b.y., by analogy to other Apollo 14 breccias). Norite clast were dated by ion probe (Nemchin et al. 2008).

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Crozaz et al. (1972) and Drozd et al. (1974) reported a cosmic ray exposure age of 25 ± 2 m.y. determined by 81Kr, supporting the idea that Cone Crater is this age.

# **Other Studies**

Micrometeorite craters on 14306 were studied by Morrison et al. (1972). Neukum et al. (1973) found that 14306 had a higher density of micrometeorites than other rocks (figure 12).

# **Processing**

14306 was studied in "consortia mode" led by E. Anders. A thick slice (,22) was cut from the center of 14306, yielding two large butt ends (,21 and ,23). There are 27 thin sections for 14306, some are cut orthogonal to the others. Note that there is a thin slice (,26) immediately adjacent to the set of thin sections produced from (,27).
