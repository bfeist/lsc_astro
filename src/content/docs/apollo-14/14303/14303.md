### **Introduction**

Lunar sample 14303 is a sample of the clast-rich, crystalline-matrix breccia that is found in abundance at the Apollo 14 site and hence probably represents the typical rock of the Fra Mauro Formation (Imbrium ejecta)(Swann et al. 1971).

Neither the location nor the surface orientation of rock 14303 could be determined from the lunar-surface photography (Swann et al. 1971). However, one side of 14303 is smoothed and rounded by micrometeorite bombardment. The other side is a large broken surface shown in figure 1. There was a large micrometeorite crater (zap pit) on the outer surface (figure 3).

14303 was returned in weigh bag #1027 which also contained fragments 14169 to 14188 (see table) as well as 14304, 14302 and 14305 – all with the same lithology. This bag also contained fines, numbered 14165-14168, including a number of 4-10 mm particles described by Kramer and Twedell (1977). The transcript shows that two large football sized rocks (14305 and 14303) were originally placed in this bag.

Apparently, they each broke off a second large part (14304 and 14302 respectively) presumably also resulting in numerous smaller fragments. Additional small rock sample and some soil were also placed in the same bag. Thus the "soil" in this bag is not considered as such, because of the added broken material from the breccia samples.

Clasts in breccias 14303 and 14304 have been used as a source of small rock fragments for study – but only a few have been demonstrated as "pristine".

### **Petrography**

The overall clastic nature of 14303 is shown in the sawn surfaces (figures 2 and 4) and in the representative thin section (figure 5). It is similar to 14305 and 14321, in that there is a "clast-in-clast" relationship indicating complex origin. Simonds et al. (1977) termed these rocks crystalline matrix breccias, because even at fine scale, there is no glass in the matrix (figure 8). They reported low porosity with about 25% clasts over 1 mm.

Chao et al. (1972), Wilshire and Jackson (1972) and Simonds et al. (1977) recognized that the matrix of 14303 (and similar A14 breccias) was strongly annealed (thermally metamorphized). They each offered various names to the texture of these rocks. On a very fine scale, the matrix is made up of interlocking grains of plagioclase, low-Ca pyroxene and ilmenite with occasional reaction rims around micro-xenocrysts of olivine, pyroxene or spinel. There is no glass nor devitrified glass in 14303 (nor its companion 14304). The name "crystalline-matrix-breccia" seems to serve best. Williams (1972) and Simonds et al. (1977) offer thermal models for the formation of matrix texture.

Wilshire and Jackson (1972) noted that there were more dark clasts than light ones. Weigand and Hollister (1972) studied the pyroxenes in the matrix and in a basalt clast (figure 6) and concluded that the pyroxenes were from "quickly cooled" surface rocks on the moon (not from depth). Roedder and Weiblen (1972a) noted

that 14303 had excess silica in the groundmass because there was a reaction rim surrounding all olivine grains in contact with the matrix. They also speculated that the numerous "granitic" materials must indicate that there is granite in the lunar highlands! Roedder and Weiblen (1972b) studied the corona around pleonaste spinel found as individual mineral clasts in 14303, again demonstrating that the clasts have reacted with the breccia matrix.

#### **Significant Clasts**

### Troctolite ,194 TS,200 TS,199 TS,198

Warren and Wasson (1980) described a prominent white clast in 14303 as a "troctolite" (70% feldspar  $An_{94.5}$ ; 30% olivine  $Fo_{87.5}$ ). It has a mass of about 2 grams, and with low siderophile element content Warren (1993) classified it as "pristine". Bersch et al. (1991) precisely determined the composition of olivine, finding low Ca content.

#### "Granite",204,206 TS,209

Warren et al. (1983, 1993) reported the chemical composition and mineral data of a "large" granite clast in 14303 and certified that it was "pristine". It has K,Ba-feldspar, silica, plagioclase  $An_{75}$ , olivine  $Fo_{42}$  and K-rich glass. Shih et al. (1993 and 1994) dated this

clast at 3.95 ± 0.38 b.y. However, Meyer et al. (1996) precisely dated the zircon in this clast as 4308 ± 3 m.y. Note that it has a REE pattern like that of KREEP, not "granite" and that it is small (~170 mg) not "large", as Warren et al. (1983) stated.

#### **HA Basalts**

Neal et al. (1989a and b) reported on 22 clasts with basaltic texture, called high-alumina (HA) basalt, that they extracted from breccia sample 14303 as part of Larry Taylor's "pull apart" project. In general, the "pristinity" of these sample has not been "certified" by careful siderophile element analysis.

#### **VHK Basalt clasts**

Neal et al. (1987, 1989) reported on numerous basalt clasts with high K (figure 8). They have a wide variety of REE contents, with broad pattern similar to the matrix (were they impure and contaminated with trace amounts of matrix?).

#### **VHK Basalt clast ,318 TS,328**

Neal et al. (1989) reported a VHK basalt clast found in 14303 with a coarse-grained, ophitic texture (table 2).

### **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of the matrix of 14303 has been determined by Rose et al. (1972) and Brunfelt et al. (1972) and is similar to that of the sawdust from 14305 (Philpotts et al. 1972)(table 1). Warren et al., Neal et al. and Snyder et al. have variously studied the composition of the clasts (figures 9 and 10).

The composition of clasts in 14303 is given in table 2. The basalt clasts are not Mare basalts, but rather a variety of high alumina basalts from lava flows that existed before the Imbrium impact. Note that the REE pattern for the "granite" clast (,204) in more like that of KREEP than of other lunar granites (figure 10).

### **Radiogenic age dating**

Kirsten et al. (1972) determined a Ar/Ar plateau age of 3.91 b.y. for the matrix (figure 11).

Shih et al. (1993, 1994) determined the age of the "granite" clast by Rb-Sr and Ca-K method (figure 12). However, Meyer et al. (1996) precisely determined the age of a large zircon in this clast as 4.308 ± 0.004 b.y. using the SHRIMP U/Pb method.

Numerous zircons have now been dated in 14303 by Nemchin et al. (2008). Taylor et al. (2009) dated additional zircons in companion rock 14304 and determined their Hf isotopic composition.

# **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Kirsten et al. (1972) reported a cosmic-ray exposure age of 29 m.y. by the 38Ar method.

# **Processing**

A slab (,8) was cut from 14303 (figures 13 and 14) and most early allocations were from this slice. An additional slab was cut in 1986 (figures 3, 15 and 16). Carlson and Walton (1978) and Twedell et al. (1978) provide some details of 14303, but no guidebook was prepared and it is now difficult to identify additional materials from clasts that were extracted from this sample.
