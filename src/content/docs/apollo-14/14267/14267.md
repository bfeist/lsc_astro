#### **Introduction**

14276 is from the "comprehensive sample" taken near the ALSEP station at Apollo 14 (Sutton et al. 1971). It is a glass-coated soil breccia (figures 1 and 2).

14276 was studied by the "European Consortium" (Eglinton et al. 1974).

#### **Petrography**

The Phinney et al. (1975) found that 14267 had a frothy glass coating on one surface, and micrometeorite pits on all sides. The interior is a vitric matrix breccia with numerous small light-colored clasts (figure 4). grain size distribution is seriate.

14276 is a fine-grained, coherent, polymict breccias with a dark matrix of vitreous appearance (Eglinton et al. 1974). There are more lithic fragments than mineral or glass fragments (figure 4). There are minute vesicles and iron grains in the glassy matrix. Clasts include glass, basalts, metaclastic breccias and mineral grains. Shock feature are prevalent (Eglinton et al.).

The majority of the vitric clasts show flow-banding. Numerous glass analyses are found in Eglinton et al.

Pyroxene and olivine analyses are presented in figure 5. Orthopyroxene and some olivine is quite mafic.

### **Chemistry**

Scoon (in Eglinton 1974) determined the chemical composition by classical techniques (table 1). The sample has the same composition as the Apollo 14 soil (figure 6).

#### **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Eglinton et al. (1974) calculate an exposure age of 60 m.y. based on 21Ne.

#### **Other Studies**

Eglinton et al. (1974) reported on cosmic-ray tracks (low), rare gas isotopes (abundant) and carbide content (low). They infer an age of 3.9 b.y. but caution that since this is obviously a soil breccias, it could be younger, with inherited 40Ar.

FeO 10.3 (a) On the lunar surface, all rocks in a 14 meter circle were MnO 0.13 (a) collected and put in weigh bag 1039, which was MgO 7.92 (a) returned in ALSRC 1007. 14267 was one of these. It CaO 10.29 (a) Na2O 0.9 (a) was studied by the "European Consortium" (Eglinton K2O 0.78 (a) et al. 1974), where it was cut exactly in half in Bristol, P2O5 0.57 (a) England and half returned to Houston Texas. There S % 0.08 (a) *sum* are 5 thin sections. There is a copy of the sample handling report in the datapack (*sans* figures). Sc ppm
