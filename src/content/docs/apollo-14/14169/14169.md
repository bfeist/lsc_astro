## **Introduction**

These 7 samples were returned in weigh bag 1027, which was apparently brought back outside of the ALSRC. According to Swann et al. (1977) part of the comprehensive sample from station H, was put in this bag, and football-sized rocks 14303, 14305 were added later because they wouldn't fit in the ALSRC. Phinney et al. (1975) concluded that samples 14169 – 14188 are all part of 14303 which broke apart during packing and transport. They based this judgment on "1) all of the smaller samples 14149 through 14188 are identical in lithology, and similar to that of 14303 and 2) all of the small samples display freshly fractured surfaces with no patina or zap pits: Most have only a very limited amount on their surfaces."

On the other hand, if one looks closely at the shapes and surfaces of these small sample (figure 1 to 7), it seems clear that they have more rounded and patina cover surfaces than the Phinney et al. team reported. Most rocks at Apollo 14 have similar lithology, so that's not an argument either. So, some of these rocks from bag 1027 may indeed be part of the "comprehensive suite" (Swann et al. 1971) and should in fact be considered as individual samples.

# **Petrography**

These small breccias samples haven't been studied, perhaps because of the observations by Phinney et al. who exclaimed that they were part of 14303.

Low-magnification photomicrographs of these rock fragments are reproduced here (figure 8 to 15) to show the overall texture of these rocks. They all have a seriate fragmental clast population and seriate grain size distribution of the matrix. A number of the broken clasts appear to be basaltic. Carlson and Kramer (1978) noted that there was glass in the matrix of some fragments in this suite (not consistent with CMB term).

Simonds et al. (1977) and Warren et al. (1980) reported composition of 3 clasts in these samples (table 1). Warren et al. make cogent arguments why the clast they studied in 14172 is actually the same clast as one in 14305 (same bag).

## **Chemistry**

Eldridge et al. (1972) reported the K, U and Th for 14169 and 14170 – confirming that these samples are like 14303. Otherwise we don't know much about these samples.

## **Cosmogenic isotopes and exposure ages**

Eldridge et al. (1972) determined the cosmic-ray induced activity of 22Na = 54 dpm/kg and 26Al = 82 dpm/kg for 14169 and 22Na = 39 dpm/kg and 26Al = 88 dpm/kg for 14170.

#### **Processing**

14169 to 14177 were returned in bag 1027 and may be pieces of 14303 or 14305 or they may be grab samples picked up from the regolith as part of the comprehensive sample.

There are 4 thin sections of 14169, 3 thin sections of 14170, 10 thin sections of 14171, 7 thin sections of 14172, 3 thin sections of 14173, 2 thin sections of 14174, and 2 thin sections of 14175.
