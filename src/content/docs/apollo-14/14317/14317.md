### **Introduction**

14317 was picked up at the "North Boulder Field" (station H) about 100 meters northwest of the LM. It is a rounded slab with a patina on one side and a few zap pits on all sides (figure 1). The rock is a coherent gray-matrix breccia with a small percentage of light clasts up to 3 mm across. this sample has not been studied.

### **Petrography**

Carlson and Walton (1978) give the only description of 14317. They reported glass and devitrified glass in the matrix, with numerous finegrained microbreccia clasts. Most of the mineral fragments are deformed pyroxene.

### **Chemistry**

None

### **Processing**

14317 was returned in weigh bag 1038 which was opened in the Crew Reception Area before the sample was entered into the NNPL for description. There is only one thin section.
