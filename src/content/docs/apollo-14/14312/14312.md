# **Introduction**

14312 was collected from atop "Turtle Rock" at the "North Boulder Field" (station H) about 100 meters northwest of the LM (Swann et al. 1977). It is a blocky, angular rock cut by irregular fractures parallel to the long axis of the rock. Glass-lined zap pits are moderately dense on all surfaces. The rock is a coherent breccia with a moderate percentage of angular dark clasts which tend to blend with the light matrix. A very few light clasts are present (Wilshire in Swann et al.)

## **Petrography**

14312 was studied by the Imbrium Consortium led by John Wood. Ryder and Bower (1976) noted that it was composed of more matrix, and less clasts than other breccias from Apollo 14. Clasts in 14312 include, dark matrix breccias, Al-rich mare basalt, poikilitic impact melt, and individual minerals. McGee et al. (1977) and Simonds et al. (1977) also provided a description.

## **Significant Clasts**

#### **High-alumina mare basalt**

Marvin in Ryder et al. (1976) illustrated photomicrographs of small fragments of mare basalt and reported the pyroxene composition (figure 8).

#### **Poikilitic Impact Melt**

Marvin in Ryder et al. (1976) found light-colored fragments of poikilitic norite (impact melt) and reported the pyroxene composition (figure 9).

#### **Ferroan Anorthosite ,53 ,57**

Warren et al. (1983) reported the composition of a very small clast of ferroan anorthosite and published a picture showing a granulated texture. It is almost all plagioclase.

#### **Troctolitic Clast**

McGee et al. (1977) show a photomicrograph of a coarsely-crystalline troctolite (figure 10).

#### Transcript again

CDR Okay, we're approaching the LM now. Coming in at Fra Mauro Base.

CC Rodger, Al, and I guess from here, we can split up; and Ed can take the MET and proceed to the cluster of boulders he had reported earlier to the north of the LM; and you can proceed out to the ALSEP.

CDR I'd suggest – well, you can do it the way you want to – I guess you can do it without the MET, because there's nobody to – if anything fall off, we've lost all those goodies.

LMP I'll just take a couple of rock bags Fredo, my tongs and camera and go. As a matter of fact, Fredo, I'm just going to take a weigh bag and no sample bag; that way I can get more. The size of these rocks – the sample bags are too small, anyhow.

LMP Okay, Fredo, my plan: I'm out in the area of the boulder field I'm going to photograph many of the boulders, the rocks, the

## **Chemistry**

The chemical composition has been determined by Marvin (1976) and Blanchard (1976).

## **Processing**

14312 was returned in weigh bag 1038 which was opened in the Crew Reception Area before the sample was entered into the NNPL for description (figure 12). There are 16 thin sections.

broken ones, the big ones, and what have you – and then, grab as many as the different fragments as I can around these piles of broken boulders. Now that I'm here, I see a large number of inclusions – I can't tell whether they're crystals or not – I think they are. And I'll grab as many of these – and give you before and after shots as I can – of a whole weigh bag full of rocks.

*Three minutes later* 

LMP Okay, Fredo, I'm heading back from the boulder field. I've samples two of the larger boulders in the area. Rocks broken from them and lying around on them; and I've taken a pan; and I have maybe a third of a weigh bag full of small rocks from these boulders.
