#### **Transcript from station E**

LMP This is a big crater. It's 40, 50 meters across. It has a fairly sharp crater in the south edge of it, which is –

CC Okay, that looks like it may be the one by E.

LMP - 20, 30 feet across. Yes, I think that's it Fredo. And it's – no, it's at least 50 or 60 feet deep.

CDR Why don't we just grab a couple from right here.

LMP Yes, Okay.

CDR That baby came apart. Very soft.

LMP Yes, it's falling apart as you pick it up, very crumbly,

isn't it?

CDR Very, ver soft rock – rim of that crater, plus another one very close to us with crystals in it, now, going into bag LMP 15-N.

## **Introduction**

From the transcript, it is clear that the astronauts put two friable samples in bag 15N, but when it was opened in the LRL there were seven fragments with a lot of "residue". 14055 and 14058 are more coherent than the other fragments (figure 1). They are also blocky, subangular to subrounded rocks lightly covered with glass-lined zap pits. The samples are friable, finegrained clastic rocks with 5 to 15 % of subrounded light-colored clasts in a medium-gray matrix.

Stoffler et al. (1979) consider 14055 a classic regolith breccia. Fruland (1983) and Simon et al. (1989) included 14055 in their suite of regolith breccias from Apollo 14.

The Apollo 14 regolith breccias (vitric matrix breccias) are slightly more aluminous than the Fra Mauro breccias (crystalline matrix breccias).

### **Petrography**

Both rocks collected at station E were friable and returned in the same bag (15N). Swann et al. (1977) reported that 14058 may be part of 14055, while 14056, 14057, 14059, 14060 and 14061 are very friable and may be pieces of the other sample. Fruland (1983) and Simon et al. (1989) included 14055 is the suite of regolith breccias. It is very like 14042, 14047 and 14049.

14055 originally had a thin layer of brown glass on one side, which has since mostly rubbed off.

Simon et al. (1989) and Drozd et al. (1976) reported a high percentage of agglutinates in 14055, while Simonds et al. (1977) found a lot of fine-grained matrix material (figure 3). The sample Drozd et al. studied may have included the glass splash on the outer surface.

Unusual fragments of ropy glass are seen in thin sections (figures 5 and 8).

### **Chemistry**

The chemical composition of 14055 is remarkably similar to that of the Apollo 14 regolith (as measured on 14163) – see table.

### **Other Studies**

Drozd et al. (1975) determined Kr and Xe concentration and isotopic ratios. Hart et al. (1972) studied the solar flare tracks. Horz et al. (1972) studied the micrometeorite craters.

## **Processing**

14055 was returned in ALSRC 1006, which was sealed. It was originally designated as a "posterity" sample – to be studied later.

There were no surface photos taken at station E. [Twedell et al. \(1978\) made maps of the surface of 14055](#page-4-0) (figure 9). There are 14 thin sections.
