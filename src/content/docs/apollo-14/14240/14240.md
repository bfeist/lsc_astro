*CC: Okay. And Al, one question, did you get the SESC sample out of the bottom of the trench?*

*CDR: Well, I told you the trench was kind of a miserable thing, because the walls kept falling down. And I could get a sample from the bottom, but it wouldn't be from the bottom, I'm afraid.*

*CC: I guess we'd still like the SESC sample form the bottom of the trench, even though it probably isn't the bottom.*

*CDR: Well, I'll tell you. I'll go back and whack at it a little bit. See what I can do.*

*CDR: We're digging the bottom of the trench for you, Fredo. I'm redigging the trench. I can't believe it!*

*LMP: What's the matter. Al?*

*CDR: Oh, that (vacuum) seal came off that thing.*

#### **Introduction**

14240 was collected from the bottom of the Soil Mechanics Trench (figure 1) and brought back in a special environmental sample container (SESC) which was opened by Burlingame in the UC Berkeley Space Science Laboratory (figure 5). However, the lid was not even finger tight and the sample probably not sealed (although the vacuum in the can may have held the lid on). The gas in the SESC was mainly N2, so the lid may have leaked in the LRL glovebox, rather than in the LM, CM or during transit.

### **Petrography**

The Soil Mechanics Trench was about 25 - 36 cm deep (Mitchell et al. 1971). 14240 was taken from the bottom (although it may contain material slumped from the walls). The trench samples were taken during the 2nd EVA from the rim of a ~6 meter crater at station G. It was planned to dig this trench to be 60 cm deep, but was cut instead to ~30 cm because the walls were caving in. According to Mitchell et al., there was noticeable color change in the wall of the trench*. "The upper 3 to 5 cm were dark brown and fine grained. Next, a very thin layer (0.5 cm thick or less) of black, glassy particles were encountered. Beneath this layer was a much lighter colored and coarser grained material."* 

Subsurface samples 14240 (and 14149 from the same trench) are both immature soils (Is/FeO = 46 and 53; Morris 1978). The soil collected from the top of the trench (14148) was more mature Is/FeO = 74.

Various small particles found in the SESC were set aside (figures 7-9).

#### **Chemistry**

Rose et al. (1972) and Laul et al. (1972) analyzed 14240 (table 1). Cadogan et al. (1972) and Moore et al. (1972) reported the carbon content (figure 4).

#### **Processing**

The samples from the bottom of this trench (14149 and 14240) may have been contaminated by surface material that fell into the trench during digging. As you can see form the transcript, 14240 was the second attempt to sample the bottom of the trench. The slightly lower maturity seems to indicate that it was less contaminated by slumped surface material.

This sample was opened in a dry He glove box at Berkeley (figure 6), and thus may be free of contamination at the LRL (or at least have a different source(s) of contamination). It has been kept in a He "bean pot" at JSC, separate from other lunar samples, all these years.

The official LRL weight was 168 grams based on the difference between the weight of hardware and weight of returned sample, but the actual weight of sample was found to be 184 grams when the sample was opened in the UCB SSL Berkeley (Burlingame 1971).
